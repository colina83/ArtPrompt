GUIDELINES FOR COMPILING A CATALOGUE RAISONNÉ 
 
 
PRELIMINARY REMARKS 
 
These guidelines are intended for those who are preparing (or considering compiling) a 
catalogue raisonné. A catalogue raisonné (from here abbreviated as CR) is understood 
as a critical catalogue of the complete, known oeuvre by a single artist or a clearly 
defined part of it (for instance the work produced in a given period or work in a specific 
medium).  

Only general guidelines can be given as each artist asks for a tailor-made 

approach. We focus here on paintings in the period 1300-1960. These guidelines are not 
exhaustive, nor iron laws but rather requirements. We hope that CR compilers will offer 
suggestions to expand them. 

The key concept for a CR is authenticity in the sense of authorship, which for 

each artist needs to be defined carefully according to a number of criteria, among which 
the most important is the studio practice of the period and of that of the relevant artist in 
particular. The term authenticity will be avoided in favour of the more objective term 
“authorship”. 

These guidelines serve a variety of goals: 

In almost every case there is a gap between the ideal and the actual production 
of a CR. Usually lack of means severely limits the possibilities of producing a CR that 
meets the desired standards. However, within these limiting parameters there is room 
for improvement.

him/her/ them aware of all the aspects involved (scholarly, scientifically, legally, 
financially and practically). 

 

 
 
 
 
COMPILING A CR 
 
I - Preparation: creating favourable conditions 
 

•  Degree in art history or command of basic art historical research skills. 

•  Review historiography and recent scholarship on the subject. 

• 

Join professional groups, such as the Catalogue Raisonné Scholars Association. 

•  Contact specialists on the subject/ check for other CR projects on the artist. 

 

 

 

 

	  

2	  

•  Explore the possibility of collaborating with other specialists as a CR calls for a 

multidisciplinary approach. 

  

•  Obtain permission to reproduce the artist’s work and try to have fees waived or reduced. 

•  Set up a computerized database to file images, data and correspondence, and establish 

protocols for naming images and files.  

•  Train your eye by examining firsthand major repositories of works of undisputed 
authorship. Obtain relevant broader connoisseurship by inspecting firsthand large 
quantities of works by similar artists of the same period. 

•  Make known you will be working on a CR:  

1  Through advertisements on the websites of appropriate institutions, in 
auction catalogues and art magazines, such as Weltkunst, Apollo, Art 
Newspaper and Art & Auction, among others.  

2  Publishing articles on your artist in scholarly periodicals. 
3  By contacting museums with holdings of works by the artist and galleries 

who handle the work of the artist.  

4    By organizing a retrospective exhibition in a museum. 
  

•  Make yourself and your CR project visible and approachable by creating a homepage 

on which you: 

1  Explain the goals and scope of the project. 
2  Add contact details and a curriculum vitae.  
3 
4  Also give a post address. Analogous photos will be less likely to have been 

Invite owners of artworks to submit data and images.  

manipulated than digital material. Material that arrives through 
conventional mail will also more often reveal from whom and where the 
images and data come from, possibly enabling the compiler to identify the 
owner and the whereabouts of the artwork. 

•  Build a website, which not only serves as a “shop sign” but also contains a secure area 
as a platform for screened specialist scholars to discuss works, upload and store data as 
well as images. This is an effective way to prepare for the ultimate publication. 
However, be careful with what you make public. 

 
 
 
 
 
II - The actual work: collecting  
 

•  Collect high quality photo material: 

1 

If possible, ask for a pair of formats: raw files (shot with a colour/ grey 
scale) and TIF (or other non-lossy image files) formats of the same images. 
Raw files are the most “objective” form of digital photographic image and 
are invaluable as the standard references. In a “lossy image”, such as a jpeg, 
data will be compressed in order to make the file size smaller and detail will 
be lost.  

3	  

 

 

 

 

	  

2  A minimum resolution should also be established, which should be a fixed 

constant to a given unit of measure; that is to say, not a file’s size, but 
rather, for example, a set of pixels per unit, such as an inch. A minimum for 
good quality and reproducibility is 300 dpi (also the standard for 
reproduction of images in Europe) but high quality images are available at 
much higher resolutions. If this is not possible, obtain good detail photos for 
surface study. Inter-comparability between images should be a goal. 
If you are taking photos yourself, consult a professional photographer in 
order to establish an effective protocol. 

4  Collect archival photos and photos showing the state of a work of art 

before, during and after a particular conservational treatment. 

In the case of Old Masters and nineteenth-century artists: consult photo 
collections, specialized libraries and research institutes, such as the Frick 
Art Reference Library (New York), Getty Research Institute (Los Angeles), 
Witt Library (London), etc., and archives of museums and galleries. 
In the case of a modern or contemporary artist: consult archives of galleries 
and of heirs/ family of the artist. Get access to the studio archive and 
interview people from the artist’s circle.   

•  Collect data:  

3 

1 

2 

•  Arrange firsthand inspection of the works by: 

1  Contacting museums, art dealers and collectors to study genuine and 

potentially genuine works thoroughly. 

2  Visiting auctions and art fairs to examine unknown works that surface. 

•  When inspecting works firsthand take photos of: 

1  Recto and verso. 
2  Stamps, seals, labels, inscriptions and other marks on the verso.   
3  Tacking edges in case of canvas support, which can give information on 

restretching, condition, lining, etc.  

4  Edges in the case of panel paintings, which can reveal traces of  paint, 

cutting or shaving 

•  When inspecting works firsthand:  

1  Take measurements of the height, width (and in case of panel paintings of 
the thickness of the panel and of the width of the individual boards if the 
panel construction consists of more than one board). 

2  Make detailed notes (with canvas if unlined by setting a small, finely 

graded, “L” shaped ruler, set aligned with the warp and weft weave of the 
canvas in a close-up image of the verso will also allow you to record canvas 
thread counts at a later time if needed; with panel note the orientation of the 
grain).  

 
These data and images may help to clarify a variety of often interrelated, aspects such as 
technique and materials used, place and date of creation, subsequent whereabouts and 
ownership, quality of execution, authorship and state of preservation. Technical details 
concerning the support may be easily documented and may prove useful to establish patterns of 
use.

•  A general but accurate account of the condition needs to be drawn up with specific 
focus on the issue of whether the condition is sufficient and the work not too much 
altered by later treatments, to allow making a statement on authorship. The condition is 
good enough if:  

1  The top paint layer is not obliterated by discoloured, darkened varnishes 

and dirt 

2  There is a substantial portion of the original paint layer preserved in which 

the artist’s handwriting and quality can be recognized.  

•  Research the provenance. 

 
A provenance ideally provides a documentary record of owners’ names; dates of ownership, and 
means of transference, i.e. inheritance, or sale through a dealer or auction, and locations where 
the work was kept, from the time of its creation by the artist until the present day.  
 
Problems: 

 
Handbooks, methods and tools:

It is very easy to fake a provenance. Therefore carefully check already 
published provenances and don’t just repeat them from secondary literature. 
It is very difficult and often impossible to find out who really owned a work 
at a given time. 
In the case of provenances of works by modern and contemporary artists a 
CR compiler is often confronted with the problem that this information will 
not be disclosed. This also applies to the more recent provenance of works 
by Old Masters and nineteenth-century artists. If the information is 
disclosed to the CR author, it is often not permitted to put it in the 
published CR. Be sure to have owners fill out documents stating their 
preferred credit line. 

1  Check the provenance guide on the website of the International Foundation 

for Art Research: http://www.ifar.org/provenance_guide.php 

2  Consult N.H. Yeide et al., The AAM Guide to Provenance Research, 

Washington 2001. 

3  Check Google images but beware of fakes.  
4  Check a work’s exhibition history and find out who lent the work (check 

annotated copies of exhibition catalogues). 

5  Check auction records by consulting annotated copies of auction catalogues 

and using printed as well as online repertories, such as:  
i.  Lugt’s Répertoire online: 

http://lugt.idcpublishers.info/content/aboutlugt.php  

ii.  Getty Provenance Index: 
iii.  http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/provenance/search.html 
iv.  Online sold lot archives of auctioneers

dealers). 

back of photographs.  

8  Look for reproductive prints (in the case of Old Masters).  
9  Look for reproductions in other publications. 

5	  

 

	  

10  Look for period and later copies of the work (mainly in the case of Old 

Masters). 

11  Check relevant, published primary source documents such as diaries and 

journals in which these works may be mentioned. 

12  Check seals, marks, inscriptions and labels on the reverse, stretchers and 

frames of the paintings. 

13  Check the aforementioned (see under Collect data) photo collections, 

specialized libraries and research institutes. 

14  Check the biographies of former owners (check biographic dictionaries and 

online historic newspaper resources). 

15  Check the archives of institutions that acted as patrons to the artist in search 

of contracts. 

16  Check probate inventories of collectors. 

 
 
III – Technical information and research: some guidelines  
 
As the technical resources available to each CR compiler will vary hugely, no single approach 
can be offered. However, there are universal recommendations that are essential. 
 

•  Collect material relating to the physical condition of the objects under study. Archival 

references, conservation dossiers, etc. 

• 

Involve a technical specialist early on.  

 
Define your questions, then discuss the possible range of solutions with a technical specialist. If 
the best route to obtaining specific information is not immediately clear, define your concerns 
and limitations, then ask for advice on how best to achieve goals within these parameters. Such 
a discussion may also help you identify features that are open to misinterpretation in the work of 
an artist (such as characteristic changes that may occur in materials, typical alterations imposed 
by historic conservation practice, etc.) and thus refine your visual evaluations. The person(s) 
you speak with should be well informed about the technical aspects of the artist you are 
researching (or of the art of the period, if that expertise does not exist). They may be 
experienced in any or all of the following disciplines: technical art history, art science or art 
conservation. By making sure that the professional/s you consult with are informed about the 
full range of material issues will bring the most profound insight into the range of issues likely 
to be encountered. 
 

•  Maximise resources. In conversation with technical specialists establish: 

1  Physical aspects that might provide maximum interest for research. 
2  Physical aspects that can be easily documented and profitably used to 

establish useful identifying data. 

3  The range of technical studies that have already been done, if any. 

Sometimes works of certain artists have been extensively imaged (X-ray, 
infrared, etc.) while in others, materials (pigments, binders and supports) 
may have been examined. 

4  Think about what of the available routes of investigation may be most 
revealing about your artist and how they may be used in a diagnostic 
fashion. (If your artist did not do under drawings, for example, then works 

 

	  

6	  

with neatly rendered, extensive under drawings may be classified as 
suspect). 

 

•  Know the limits  

 
It is essential to understand what the limits of technical research are, although clearly not the 
fine details of their practice. A qualified colleague should be able to discuss the potential and 
limitations for technical studies to make this clear. This will avoid over-reliance on certain data, 
and mis-trust of others that can result from a poor grasp of what can be accomplished. As most 
art historians are not taught to be educated consumers of technical data, a good working 
relationship with informed colleagues is of great value. A technical specialist might be involved 
as a CR team member or consultant. They should be able to articulate how a suggested 
approach to investigation might work, why the methods used are well suited, the pro’s and 
con’s of any given approach, and how this information will serve to enhance the CR. 
 
Do not over- or underestimate the results of a technical study. A technical study may rule out an 
attribution or a proposed dating of a specific work. It may articulate how a work conforms to 
what is known of a specific artist’s materials and practice. However, a technical report will not 
“authenticate” a work of art; it is an accessory to doing so, not a means in and of itself. A good 
technical study tests a hypothesis. It will articulate a starting question, explain what was done 
by what means, and the extent of the comparative material that is available for contextualisation 
of results. Often technical studies are constricted by budgets and limitations of equipment; this 
context is essential to recognise. Understand what the report has undertaken and what it has 
concluded (for example: just because nothing has been found to be “wrong” does not mean a 
work is “good”; not all points may have been checked, the work may be a contemporary 
production, a forger may have used historically accurate materials, etc.). Again, ask questions of 
the author of a report if you are unsure of a report’s implications; if this is not possible, or if you 
feel a second opinion is necessary, consult with an independent specialist of equal standing.  
 
Remember the rule of the false positive: in technical study as in connoisseurship, if it is too 
focused on the work of a single artist, it can be impossible to distinguish actual individual 
characteristics of an artist from generic features. It is also essential to examine/ discuss the art 
technological context of a given artist alongside the particular study of their work. 
 
If you are able to commission any technical study, think carefully about the long-term storage 
and utility of the collected materials. Removing samples from objects is a serious matter not to 
be undertaken lightly. Removal of material from art objects physically compromises them and 
should be done as little as possible and for well defined reasons. (Indeed, some of the 
international organisations for conservation of cultural material include guidance for such issues 
in their codes of ethics and professional guidelines). 
It is essential to plan for: 

1  Archival storage and reuse/re-examination of sample material taken. 

Scientific techniques are constantly changing, and interpretation of data is 
not an absolute. Samples should be available for re-examination in the 
future, as should data, just as the art historical evidence should be available 
for consideration by colleagues. 

2  Again, remember the concept of inter-comparability. Whenever possible, 

have established protocols for data collection so your information is as 
useful as possible. 

	  

7	  

3  Accessibility of information. Technical information should be reviewed, 
discussed and shared. Presentation of work at peer-reviewed conferences 
can bring technical research to the attention of the wide art community and 
may also attract useful commentary from other professionals working in the 
field, and thus new insights. 

4  Choose objects for study with care. If an object is to be examined for 

technical study, known its condition and the significance that this implies. 
One object may be of value to illustrate material weaknesses inherent in the 
work of a particular artist; thus an object in poor condition may be highly 
significant to examine and understand. Another work may be of value due 
to its exemplary state of preservation, another due to its novelty of 
technique. Identify and exploit technical examination of such works by 
establishing a defined protocol and specify features of interest. 

5  Establish networks. Complex problems are best approach with a wide range 

of insight. No one expert will have exclusive or full knowledge. Identify 
people who are interested in your issues, and seek their advice Researchers 
who work in isolation are rarely effective. 

6  Ensure that documentation is carefully undertaken and archived. 

 
 
IV - The intellectual work: further research, processing and interpreting 
 
 

•  Establish the artist's biography in order to know when and where works were executed.  

•  Establish a chronology of the artist’s work:  

1  Make a list of dated works as a framework of reference.   
2  For nineteenth-century and modern artists; find out when works of art were 

first exhibited or photographed. Archival images are crucial to dating and 
understanding the work in order to determine by what date they existed. 
However, be aware that archival photos may be misleading. 

 
A chronology will often reveal the artist’s technical and stylistic development. These processes 
need to be described and analyzed. This assessment will serve, among many other arguments 
and evidence, as a criterion to judge the authorship of new works.   
 

•  Establish criteria for accepting works:  

1  Create a definition of authorship based on the artist’s biography, technique, 

studio practice, chronology and style.  

2  Note aspects that you observe that might be helpful in establishing patterns 
of working or which would be suited to further investigation by a specialist 
colleague. For example: use of under drawing, particular surface effects, 
reoccurring problems of condition. 

•  Gain insight into other relevant aspects typical of the artist’s oeuvre (such as working 

methods and materials, studio practice, sources of inspiration etc.). 

•  When speaking to specialists in art technology, provide them with as much information 
as you can regarding specific avenues of investigation that might help you, and specific 
visual observations you have made. Speak with a specialist in advance of starting your 

 

 

 

	  

8	  

work. Establish a list of potentially useful technical characteristics to look for/ at in 
works examined. If there are archival sources relating to the purchase and use of 
materials, discuss these in advance of planning an examination protocol. 

 
 
 
V - Side aspects: scholarly independence, accountability and liability  
 
 

•  Keep careful records of visits to museums, collectors and art dealers of works seen and 

discussed and file related correspondence. 

•  Make clear agreements with owners of artworks about how they wish to be mentioned 

in the CR. 

•  Only issue an opinion on authorship outside the purely scholarly discourse in writing 

when requested by the owner of the work. Requests may always be turned down. 

• 

If you give an opinion, first consult one of the standard opinion request forms available 
through the abovementioned Catalogue Raisonné Scholars Association, which helps to 
protect from legal action, financial responsibility for shipping and insurance, and other 
impositions on the scholar. 

•  Obtain insurance (for example, authors errors and omissions policy). 

•  Find out who owns the work and obtain a form of release and indemnity signed by the 

owner (not a third party) to reduce your exposure to lawsuits. 

•  Always be careful with what you write and emphasise, especially to owners not familiar 

with the laws of academic research, that the statement is your personal opinion and 
reflects the current state of research, and that naturally these opinions may change over 
time by virtue of new insights 

•  Do not call a statement on authorship ‘certificate’ or ‘expertise’ but a ‘scholarly 

opinion’.  

•  Do not ask for a fee when issuing an opinion on authorship. If a party asks for an 

extensive report an hourly fee may be asked for.  

 
 
 
VI - Structuring the CR: presenting the material 
 

• 

In the case of Old Masters:  
 

Design a structure that contains sections with works that you consider doubtful, works you 
reject and with works you know from old sources. Doubtful and rejected works often figure 
in previous scholarly literature and sources. Therefore, to officially reject a work or cast 
doubt on its authorship in the CR, mentioning the arguments, is a necessary contribution to 
the critical discourse on the status of these works.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

	  

9	  

 

 

• 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

	  

For compilers of a CR of an Old Master, this is a differentiated list (not all categories are useful 
in every case; some are interchangeable or overlap): 
 

1  Accepted works 

2  Collaborative works 

3  Works from the studio  

4  Attributed works 

5  Doubtful works 

6  Works not seen by the present author 

7  Rejected works 

8  Works known from photographs 

9  Works known from reproductive prints 

10  Works known from descriptions or other documents  

In the case of CRs of modern and contemporary artists these sections are usually 
omitted and the catalogue solely consists of accepted works. 

 
 
For compilers of both Old Master CRs and those working on more modern masters, a category 
meriting special attention consists of so-called dead works or archival works. These are works 
of which the state is so deplorable and of which so little original paint and of the support 
remains that they cannot be catalogued among the accepted works without at least making a 
clear note about its severely bad condition.   
 
In each case, indicate the level of certainty regarding the classification, and the type of 
supporting evidence used to obtain it. If there is technical analysis available, indicate this. When 
no technical evidence is implied, it may be assumed that none was known to the scholar. 
 
A second layer of structuring is strongly dependent on the artist and the type of work he/she 
made. A chronological ordering is prevalent in many CRs but will not always be of use, for 
instance in the case of an artist who only worked for a short span of time, did not date any of his 
works and does not display any clear development in his work. 
 
 
 
VII - Publishing: what to include in the catalogue and how to present it 
 

•  The published CR should meet eight requirements:  

10	  

1  Accuracy (no factual errors, questionable omissions or misrepresentation of 

previous scholarship). 

2  Clarity (unequivocal phrasing). 
3  Coherence (the material should be presented in a logical and balanced 

4  Consistency (no conflicting statements or visions). 
5  Completeness (as far as possible and within the limits the CR author has set 

framework). 

himself). 

6  Correspondence (approach and organization of catalogue follows from 

nature of artist’s work).  

7  Practicality (user friendly). 
8  Transparency (as regards method, goals set and self-chosen limitations). 
9  Confidentiality (with regards of the identity of present owners and, 

sometimes, locations). 

•  Apart from the CR proper, it should include the following contents: 

1 

Introduction on goals set, limitations, method and underlying theory, 
especially definition of authorship and clear criteria for accepting works as 
autograph. 
Instructions for practical use. 

2 
3  Scholarly apparatus (search aids, concordances, indices, list of 

abbreviations, list of illustrations, bibliography, list of exhibitions cited in 
abbreviated form, appendices for example of important documents). 

4  Photo credits. 

 
Ad libitum one could add: 

1  A disclaimer  
2  CV author/ team/ committee 

•  On entry level the following nine rubrics should be considered: 

1  Catalogue number (and including artist's own record or artist's studio 

numbers; also catalogue number from previous CRs). 

2  Title or short description:  

Depending on the artist, the CR author needs to indicate basis for 
establishing titles in general: author's title, title when first exhibited, 
inscribed title, museum title (often required by photo permission form).  
Followed by a listing of alternative titles. Also consider what language is 
used for primary title and who translates titles consistently into another 
language. If the original title is not that of the language used for the CR, the 
original language title should be included; if this is in the artist’s mother 
tongue this is essential. This may help in conducting research on the 
artwork. 

3  Present whereabouts and ownership:  

Inquire with the museum, gallery or collector if there are specific credit 
lines that have to be followed or wishes regarding confidentiality. 

4  Basic technical details:  

Medium (be cautious with the phrasing: without technical analysis it is 
often impossible to identify the medium with the naked eye).  
Support.  
Dimensions.  

 

 

	  

11	  

Signatures and dates and other inscriptions in the artist’s hand as well as 
later additions.   
Note, if applicable, the plain fact that the work has been inspected firsthand. 
Note exactly what is known, how it is known and what is merely assumed, 
to avoid oversimplification.  
Image (front and, if instructive, the back; for example the verso of a 
painting which has been lined and put on a new stretcher will be of far less 
interest than one that is unlined on its original stretcher) 

5 

6  Provenance:  

Follow a well defined structure. 
The provenance should be backed by references to previous literature or 
other sources. 
For Old Masters and nineteenth-century artists include prices fetched at 
auction as well as prices paid in private deals (if they are known).  
Also include the present owner and whereabouts (pay attention to credit 
lines and confidentiality if required; see above). 

7  References (; exhibition history, literature as well as unpublished PhD and 

Master’s theses; unpublished reports and other documentation to be 
discussed in the text of the entry). 

8  Condition and technical research (keep the assessment concise and 
straightforward. Note if the observations and research are based on 
firsthand inspection or on reports provided by the owner of the artwork or 
coming from some other source, taking into account the occasion and 
purpose of the report, the date and the conditions under which the research 
or examinations were carried out. If it is not possible to include consistent 
information it is useful to highlight “exemplar” works from various periods, 
which represent the work of the artist as it should be. Other features such as 
cases where an artist has rejected certain effects – such as for example 
varnishes – are equally essential to note. This can be hugely helpful for 
scholars using the CR in order to calibrate their perception.) 

9  Commentary (only if necessary; for instance when the CR author disagrees 
with previously expressed opinions to explain his reasoning and to discuss 
peculiar aspects of the given work or issues of dating and comparison with 
other works).

PREFACE

A Dictionary of Artifacts is for students, archaeology professors, archaeo-
logists, museum staff, archaeology volunteers, and general readers who
want informative deﬁnitions in accessible language about the vocabulary
describing artifacts. More than 2000 entries cover all aspects of artifacts:
speciﬁc artifact types, prominent examples of artifacts, technological terms,
culture  periods,  words  associated  with  the  making  of  and  description 
of artifacts (including materials and methods), principles and techniques
of examination and identiﬁcation, and terms regarding the care and preser-
vation of specimens.

Artifacts are anything made and/or used by humans, including tools,
containers, manufacturing debris, and food remains. The coverage includes
vocabulary used to describe artifacts (e.g., plaited, tenoned), vocabulary
concerned with their discovery, analysis, typology, dating, and conserva-
tion (e.g., cordage, seriation), and types of basic artifacts (e.g., abrader,
milling stone). This is neither an encyclopedia nor an encyclopedic dic-
tionary. This book does not include architecture (e.g., building compo-
nents, features) or speciﬁc historical artifacts (e.g., the Hope Diamond).
Only  very  major  subtypes  are  deﬁned;  for  example,  not  every  type  of
adze, point, or ware is included. Major time periods are included, but
only the ones that are fairly uncontroversial and those referred to in the
deﬁnitions of other entries.

The entries in this book are terms regarding:

• artifact analysis, examination, and identiﬁcation
• artifact care, handling, and preservation
• artifact decoration
• artifact description (shape, use-wear, function)
• artifact production and technology (including materials and methods)

PREFACE

• prominent examples of artifacts (but not every type of adze, point,

•

ware, etc.)
speciﬁc artifact types (in bone/horn, ceramic, glass, lithic, metal, shell,
textile/basket, wood, etc.)

Knowledge about artifacts is helpful to students in many areas, espec-
ially in the ﬁeld and on visits to museums. Artifacts are the tangible remains
of  our  ancestors  and  awareness  of  them  and  their  importance  is
beneﬁcial to a student’s well-rounded education. A Dictionary of Artifacts
will also be useful for teaching. However, many very technological and
methodological entries that are only of interest to professional archae-
ologists  are  not  included,  as  well  as  the  thousands  of  possible  pottery
types and – if you think about it – the whole gamut of possible artifacts
(cell phone, cellophane tape!?).

While  most  archaeologists  generally  know  the  meaning  of  terms 
used in the areas of their own research, it is often difﬁcult to ﬁnd good
deﬁnitions of artifacts for unfamiliar time periods or cultures. This book
attempts to be cross-cultural and cross-Atlantic in selections and deﬁni-
tions. A certain number of out-of-date terms are deﬁned because these
terms appear in literature that is still read.

This book is an especially good introduction to the world of artifacts,
culling  the  types  of  entries  that  are  found  in  larger  and  more  general
archaeological dictionaries and adding to that list in useful ways with-
out getting overly technical or specialized. The reader will not ﬁnd very
speciﬁc artifacts, all possible cultures, all of the highly technical words
for a ﬁeld – such as all the techniques and materials used for preserv-
ing ceramics or lithics in the laboratory. A Dictionary of Artifacts puts
into one place the basic terminology for all categories of artifacts.

abacus: a calculating table or frame, speciﬁcally one in which balls slide
upon wires, used for the mechanical solution of arithmetical problems.
Abbevillian:  name  for  the  period  of  the  earliest  hand-ax  industries  of
Europe, taken from Abbeville, the type site near the mouth of the River
Somme in northern France. The site is a gravel pit in which crudely
chipped oval or pear-shaped hand axes were discovered, probably dat-
ing  to  the  Mindel  glaciation.  This  was  one  of  the  key  places  which
showed  that  man  was  of  great  antiquity.  In  1939,  Abbé  Breuil  pro-
posed  the  name  Abbevillian  for  both  the  hand  ax  and  the  industry,
which preceded the Acheulian in Europe.

Abejas phase: ﬁrst important agricultural phase in the Tehuacan Valley

of Mexico, dated 3500–1500 bc, after the introduction of maize.

Abingdon ware: a Neolithic pottery c. 3900–3200 bc, found in a cause-
wayed camp about 15 km south of Oxford, England. The pottery is
fairly  heavy  and  formed  into  round-bottomed  bowls  with  frequent-
stroke decoration and some having handles.

abrade: to scrape or wear away by friction or erosion. [abrasion (n.)]
abrader:  a  stone  tool  with  abrasive  qualities,  such  as  pumice  or  sand-
stone,  used  in  grinding,  smoothing,  sharpening,  or  shaping  tools  or
other objects. [abrading stone]

absolute age: amount of time elapsed, with reference to a speciﬁc time

scale, since an object was made or used.

absolute  dating:  determination  of  age  with  reference  to  a  speciﬁc  time
scale, such as a ﬁxed calendrical system or in years before present (bp),
based on measurable physical and chemical qualities or historical associ-
ations  such  as  coins  and  written  records.  The  date  on  a  coin  is  an
absolute date, as are ad 1492 and 501 bc. [see relative dating]

absorption: process by which a liquid is drawn into and ﬁlls the pores

of a permeable, porous body.

ABYDOS,  TABLETS  OF

Abydos, tablets of: two hieroglyphic inscriptions containing the names
of Egyptian kings that were found on the walls in a small temple at
Abydos, Egypt. The ﬁrst tablet has the names of the kings of the 12th
and 18th dynasties and it is now in the British Museum. The second
tablet begins with Menes, one of the ﬁrst kings of Egypt, and has a
complete list of the ﬁrst two dynasties as well as a number of names
from the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 9th, 10th, and 11th dynasties. It was dis-
covered  in  1864  by  Auguste  Mariette,  who  published  the  book
Abydos in 1869.

Abydos ware: pottery of Canaanite (Syro-Palestinian) origin found in the
royal tombs of the 1st and 2nd dynasties (the Old Kingdom) at Abydos,
Saqqara, Abusir el-Melek, and other sites in Upper Egypt, dating to
the Early Bronze Age II (3300–2700 bc). The pottery, often red-rose
slipped and burnished or painted with geometric motifs, includes jugs,
bottles,  and  jars.  Most  common  are  the  red-slipped  jugs,  some  of  a
hard-baked “metallic” quality, with handles attached to the rim and
a typical stamped base. This pottery class took its name from Abydos,
the ﬁrst site at which it was found, in Upper Egypt.

acanthus:  conventionalized  representation  of  the  leaf  of  the  Acanthus
spinosus plant, found on the lower parts of Corinthian and Composite
capitals, and also used for enrichment of various elements in Classical
architecture.

accession:  an  object  acquired  by  a  museum  or  collector  as  a  part  of  a
permanent collection; also, the act of processing and recording an addi-
tion to a permanent collection.

accession  catalog:  an  accounting  system  used  in  the  lab  after  artifacts
and  ecofacts  are  initially  processed  and  providing  the  numbers  with
which  artifacts  and  ecofacts  are  marked  for  storage.  Its  records
describe and record what was found during an archaeological invest-
igation and it is the primary record for all materials after excavation.
[accession catalogue]

accession number: number assigned to an archaeological collection that

identiﬁes its origin; part of the catalog number.

aceramic:  without  pottery  or  not  using  pottery;  a  term  applied  to 
periods and societies in which pottery is not used, especially in con-
trast  to  other  periods  of  ceramic  use  and  with  neighboring  ceramic
cultures. Aceramic societies may use bark, basketry, gourds, leather,
etc. for containers.

Aceramic Neolithic: early part of the Neolithic period in western Asia
before  the  widespread  use  of  pottery  (c.  8500–6000 bc)  in  an  eco-
nomy based on the cultivation of crops or the rearing of animals or
both.  Aceramic  Neolithic  groups  were  in  the  Levant  (Pre-Pottery
Neolithic  A  and  B),  Zagros  area  (Karim  Shahir,  Jarmoan),  and

ACINACES

Anatolia (Hacilar Aceramic Neolithic). Aceramic Neolithic groups are
rarer outside western Asia.

Acheulian:  a  European  culture  of  the  Lower  Paleolithic  period  named
for Saint-Acheul, a town in northern France, the site of numerous stone
artifacts  from  the  period.  The  conventional  borderline  between
Abbevillian  and  Acheulian  is  marked  by  a  technological  innovation
in the working of stone implements, the use of a ﬂaking tool of soft
material (wood, bone, antler) in place of a hammerstone. This culture
is noted for its hefty multipurpose, pointed (or almond-shaped) hand
axes,  ﬂat-edged  cleaving  tools,  and  other  bifacial  stone  tools  with 
multiple  cutting  edges.  The  Acheulian  ﬂourished  in  Africa,  western
Europe, and southern Asia from over a million years ago until less than
100,000  years  ago  and  is  commonly  associated  with  Homo  erectus.
This progressive tool industry was the ﬁrst to use regular bifacial ﬂak-
ing.  The  term  Epoque  de  St  Acheul  was  introduced  by  Gabriel  de
Mortillet in 1872 and is still used occasionally, but after 1925 the idea
of  epochs  began  to  be  supplanted  by  that  of  cultures  and  traditions
and it is in this sense that the term Acheulian is more often used today.
The  earliest  assemblages  are  often  rather  similar  to  the  Oldowan  at
such  sites  as  Olduvai  Gorge.  Subsequent  hand-ax  assemblages  are 
found over most of Africa, southern Asia, and western and southern
Europe.  The  earliest  appearance  of  hand  axes  in  Europe  is  still  ref-
ereed to by some workers as Abbevillian, denoting a stage when hand
axes were still made with crude, irregular devices. The type site, near
Amiens  in  the  Somme  Valley,  contained  large  hand-ax  assemblages
from around the time of the penultimate interglacial and the succeeding
glacial  period  (Riss),  perhaps  some  200,000–300,000  years  ago.
Acheulian hand axes are still found around the time of the last inter-
glacial period, and hand axes are common in one part of the succeeding
Mousterian period (the Mousterian of Acheulian tradition) down to
as recently as 40,000 years ago. Acheulian is also used to describe the
period  when  this  culture  existed.  In  African  terminology,  the  entire
series of hand-ax industries is called Acheulian, and the earlier phases
of  the  African  Acheulian  equate  with  the  Abbevillian  of  Europe.
[Acheulean, Acheulian industry]

Achzib ware: a Phoenician, Iron Age II, red-slip pottery type consisting
primarily of jugs with a trefoil mouth of “mushroom” rims, red slipped,
and highly burnished.

acid  etching:  use  of  hydroﬂuoric  acid  to  etch  a  pattern  onto  a  glass 

surface.

acinaces: a short sword or scimitar, often very short and worn suspended
from  a  belt  around  the  waist,  and  used  by  Eastern  nations  of  anti-
quity, especially the Medes, Persians, and Scythians.

4

ACISCULUS

Roman times.

acisculus:  a  small  pick  used  by  stone-cutters  and  masons  in  early

aclis: a small javelin or harpoon, consisting of a thick short pole set with
spikes. This massive weapon resembles a trident or angon. [aclys, aclyx]
acoustic  vase:  large  earthenware  or  bronze  vases  that  were  used  to
strengthen actors’ voices and were placed in bell towers to help boost
the sound of church bells. A church in Westphalia contains ﬁne 9th-
century Badorf wares, and larger relief-band amphorae were used in
10th- and 11th-century churches. [acoustic vessel]

acquisition:  ﬁrst  stage  of  the  behavioral  processes  (followed  by  manu-

facture, use, and deposition), in which raw materials are procured.

acratophorum: a Greek and Roman table vessel for holding pure wine, as
opposed to the crater which held wine mixed with water. This vessel
was often made of earthenware and metal, though some were gold or
silver.

acrolith: a Greek statue, of which the head and extremities were of stone
or marble and the trunk crafted of wood which was either gilt or draped.
The acrolith period was the infancy of Greek plastic art.

acroterion:  a  sculptured  ﬁgure,  tripod,  disk,  or  urn,  made  of  bronze, 
marble, or terra cotta, placed on the apex of the pediment of a Greek
temple or other substantial building.

activity: used to describe the customary use of a given artifact, such as

food preparation.

activity area: 1. A place where a speciﬁc ancient activity was located or
carried out, such as food preparation or stone toolmaking. The place
usually corresponded to one or more features and associated artifacts
and ecofacts. In American archaeology, the term describes the smallest
observable component of a settlement site. 2. A patterning of artifacts
in a site indicating that a speciﬁc activity, such as stone toolmaking,
took place.

activity set: a set of artifacts that reveals the activities of a person.
acute: in lithics, severe short angles coming to a sharp point.
AD: used as a preﬁx to a date, it indicates years after the birth of Christ
or the beginning of the Christian calendar. Anno Domini (Latin) means
“In the year of our Lord.” The lower case “ad” represents uncalibrated
radiocarbon years and ad denotes a calibrated radiocarbon date or a
historic date that does not need calibration. There is no year 0; 1 bc
is followed by ad 1.

additive: an organic or mineral material mixed with clay by the potter

to modify its properties in forming, drying, and ﬁring. [temper]

additive  technology:  manufacturing  processes  in  which  material  is
added  to  an  original  mass  to  form  an  artifact.  Ceramic  production
and basketmaking are additive technologies.

ADZE

Adena:  a  widespread  Native  American  culture  of  the  Early  Woodland
period in the Ohio Valley and named after the Adena Mounds of Ross
County. It is known for its ceremonial and complex burial practices
involving the construction of mounds and by a high level of craftwork
and  pottery.  It  is  dated  from  as  early  as  c.  1250 bc and  ﬂourished
between c. 700 and 200 bc. It is ancestral to the Hopewell culture in
that region. It was also remarkable for long-distance trading and the
beginnings of agriculture. The mounds (e.g., Grave Creek Mound) are
usually conical and they became most common around 500 bc. There
was also cremation. Artifacts include birdstones, blocked-end smok-
ing  pipes,  boatstones,  cord-marked  pottery,  engraved  stone  tablets, 
and  hammerstones.  Artifacts  distinctive  of  Adena  include  a  tubular
pipe style, mica cutouts, copper bracelets and cutouts, incised tablets,
stemmed  projectile  points,  oval  bifaces,  concave  and  reel-shaped 
gorgets,  and  thick  ceramic  vessels  decorated  with  incised  geometric
designs. [Adena point]

Adena-Rossville point: contracting stemmed point with a narrower sec-

tion at the base than the main part of the arrowhead point.

adobe: Spanish term for sun-dried mud brick; also the name for a struc-
ture built out of this material. These claylike buff or brown mud bricks
were not ﬁred, but hardened and dried in the sun. The material was
also used as mortar, plaster, and amorphous building material for walls.
Adobe structures are found in the southwestern US and Mexico where
there is heavy-textured clay soil and a sunny climate. These structures
were often houses, temples, and large solid platforms in the shape of
truncated pyramids.

adsorption: capacity of a material to accept and retain another substance,

such as moisture, on its surface.

adze: a cutting tool, similar to an ax, in which
the  blade  is  set  at  right  angles  to  the  handle
or  haft.  One  of  the  earliest  tools,  it  was
widely  distributed  in  Stone  Age  cultures  in 
the form of a handheld stone chipped to form
a  blade.  By  Egyptian  times,  it  was  made  of
stone,  metal,  or  shell  and  had  acquired  the 
handle. It is distinguished from the ax (work-
ing  edge  parallel  with  the  haft)  by  its  asym-
metrical  cross-section.  This  carpenter’s  tool  was  used  for  rough
dressing of timber and possibly for tree felling and for hollowing out
a  dugout  canoe.  The  adze  also  was  used  in  the  ritual  ceremony
“opening  of  the  mouth”  in  Egypt;  touching  it  to  the  mouth  of  the
mummy or statue of the deceased was thought to restore the senses.

of polished stone.

adze hammer: a shaft-hole adze with additional hammer knob, normally

Aeginetan marbles: archaic Greek sculpture discovered in the temple of
Pallas-Athene at Aegina, an island in the Saronic group of Greece. They
are in the Glyptothek at Munich, Germany. Aegina’s period of glory
was the 5th century bc, which left a legacy of sculpture.

aegis: a shield or defensive armor in ancient mythology, from the Greek
word  for  shield;  also  used  to  describe  the  representation  of  a  neck-
lace on the head of a deity.

aegyptiaca: a term sometimes applied to Egyptian objects found outside

the borders of Egypt.

aeolipilae: name of a Greek metal vase with a narrow opening. It was
ﬁlled with water and placed on a ﬁre to make the chimney draw better
or to indicate the wind’s direction. [aeolipylae, eolipyle]

aestel: an object to point at words whilst reading.
African red-slip ware: a type of red gloss pottery made in North Africa
from the 3rd to 6th centuries ad. The pieces had stamped decoration
and were widely distributed.

agate glass: a striped-pattern glass created by mixing molten glass of dif-

ferent colors. The colored bands resemble those of natural agate.
agateware: any pottery that is veined and mottled to resemble agate.
Age of Discovery: a time of Western expansion through European explora-
tion, discovery, and enlightenment about the world, which occurred
from about the 15th through the 18th centuries, c. 1515–1800.

aggregate: an inert component such as grog or potter’s ﬂint in ceramic

bodies (especially triaxial bodies). [ﬁller, temper]

aging: storing prepared ceramic material (as a wet plastic clay body) to
improve its working properties by thorough wetting of particles, slow
compression, bacterial action (souring), and other processes.

aiguille: a needle-shaped drill for boring holes in rock or masonry.
Ajuerado phase: earliest phase of pre-village, pre-agriculture in Tehuacan
Valley,  Mexico,  from  c.  7200  to  7000 bc.  There  was  hunting  and 
gathering.

alabaster: a term used by Egyptologists for a type of white, semitrans-
parent  or  translucent  stone  used  in  statuary,  vases,  sarcophagi,  and
architecture. It is a form of limestone (calcium carbonate), sometimes
described as travertine. It was used increasingly from the Early Dynastic
period for funerary vessels as well as for statuary and altars. Alabaster
is found in Middle Egypt, a main source being Hatnub, southeast of
el-Amarna. The sarcophagi of Seti I (British Museum) is a ﬁne example.
An  alabaster  (also  alabastron  or  alabastrum)  is  also  the  name  of  a
small vase or jar for precious perfumes or oils made of this material.
It was often globular with a narrow mouth and often without handles.

alabastron:  a  Greek  container  made  of  alabaster,  but  sometimes  clay,

used for unguents. [alabastrum]

albarello:  a  late  medieval  (15th  to  18th  centuries)  Near  East,  Spanish,
and Italian apothecary pottery jar. It was made in the form known as
majolica or with a ﬁne tin glaze over typically blue designs imitating
the forms of Arabic script. Its basic shape was cylindrical but incurved
and wide-mouthed for holding, using, and shelving. They average 18 cm
(7  inches)  high  and  are  free  of  handles,  lips,  and  spouts.  A  piece  of
paper  or  parchment  was  tied  around  the  rim  as  a  cover  for  the  jar.
Drug jars from Persia, Syria, and Egypt were introduced into Italy by
the 15th century, and luster-decorated pots inﬂuenced by the Moors
in  Spain  entered  through  Sicily.  Spanish  and  Islamic  inﬂuence  is
apparent  in  the  colors  used  in  the  decoration  of  early  15th-century
Italian albarelli, which are often blue on white. A conventional oak-
leaf and ﬂoral design, combining handsomely with heraldic shields or
with scrollwork and an inscribed label, frequently occurs. Geometric
patterns  are  also  common.  By  the  end  of  the  18th  century,  albarelli
had  yielded  to  other  containers.  Albarelli  have  occasionally  been
found in Britain and the Netherlands. [albarelli (pl.)]

albarium: a white lime coating or type of stucco used in Roman times,
used to cover brick walls after cement was applied. The mixture con-
tained chalk, plaster, and white marble.

album: in Roman and Greek antiquity, a blank tablet on which praetors’
edicts and other public notices were recorded for public information.
It was also a space on the surface of a wall, covered with white plaster,
upon which were written such announcements or advertisements. After-
wards,  this  term  was  extended  to  denote  any  kind  of  white  tablets
bearing an inscription.

alembic:  a  round  apparatus  formerly  used  in  distilling,  consisting  of  a
cucurbit  or  gourd-shaped  vessel  containing  the  substance  to  be  dis-
tilled  and  the  upper  part,  the  alembic  proper,  which  was  a  head  or
cap. The beak or downward-sloping spout of the apparatus conveyed
the condensed product to another vessel.

Alexandrinum: a type of mosaic used especially for Roman rooms, notably
in  the  9th  century.  It  used  tiny,  geometrically  shaped  pieces  of  col-
ored stone and glass paste that were arranged in intricate geometric
patterns dotted with large disks of semiprecious stones. It often was
of only two colors, red and black, on a white ground.

Alfred Jewel: an elaborate gold ornament which is an example of 9th-
century Anglo-Saxon craftsmanship and found at Somerset, England in
1893 (now in Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). It consists of an enameled
plaque with an oval portrait in different-colored cloisonné, enhanced
with  ﬁligree  wire  and  backed  by  a  ﬂat  piece  of  gold  engraved  with

8

ALFRED  JEWEL

foliate decoration. Engraved around the frame are the Old English words
which  translate  to  “Alfred  ordered  me  to  be  made,”  assumed  to  be
King Alfred.

alkaline glaze: a relatively low-ﬁred glaze with a high concentration of
alkali elements in its composition, often with wood ash in signiﬁcant
quantity.

Allerød oscillation: an interstadial (transient) period of glacial retreat at
the  close  of  the  Würm  glacial  stage  in  Europe,  dated  to  c.  12,000–
11,000 years ago. This temporary increase in warmth allowed forests
to establish themselves for a time in the ice-free zones. Radiocarbon
dates  show  similar  conditions  prevailed  in  North  America  at  about
the same time. It was followed by another cold, glacial advance.

alloy:  any  of  a  number  of  substances  which  are  a  mixture  of  two  or
more metals, such as bronze (copper and tin), brass (copper and zinc),
or tumbaga (copper and gold). An alloy has properties superior to those
of the individual metals. They are not simple mixtures, but complex
crystalline  structures  that  may  differ  considerably  from  any  of  their
constituents.  Slight  alterations  of  the  proportions  of  the  metals  can
bring  signiﬁcant  changes  in  the  properties  of  the  alloy.  Alloys  con-
taining only two major metals are known as binary alloys and those
with three as ternary alloys. Gold is alloyed with various metals; when
mixed with mercury it is called an amalgam, and with silver, it is called
native  gold.  Bronze  was  the  most  important  alloy  in  antiquity.  The
term is also used to describe the technique of mixing the metals.

all-purpose  tool:  a  rare  stone  artifact  that  could  be  used  for  perforat-
ing, cutting, and scraping – normally larger than a thumb scraper or
a drill but smaller than a large knife or scraper. It always has one end
worked  to  a  point  for  perforation  with  the  opposite  end  worked  in
the form of an end scraper. One side is worked rather delicately for
use as a knife. It is almost always oblong in shape.

altarpiece: a decorative piece connected to the altar.
alternate  ﬂaking:  the  opposite  face  of  each  edge  is  steeply  ﬂaked  and

each face opposing the beveled edge is ﬂatly ﬂaked.

alternating retouch: retouch that occurs on an edge of a lithic ﬂake in
such a way that it alternates between the dorsal and ventral sides from
one end to the other of the edge. [alternate retouch]

Altithermal: a warm, dry postglacial period in the western United States
c. 5600–2500 bc. Coined by Ernst Antev in 1948, the term describes a
time during which temperatures were warmer than at present. Other
terms, like “long drought,” are also used.

Amarna  period:  a  phase  in  the  late  18th  dynasty,  including  the  reigns
of Akhenaten, Smenkhkare, Tutankhamen, and Ay (1379–1352 bc),
when important religious and artistic changes took place. The name
is derived from the site of Akhenaten’s capital at Tell el-Amarna.

AMULET

amber:  fossilized  pine  resin,  a  transparent  yellow,  orange,  or  reddish-
brown  material  from  coniferous  trees.  It  is  amorphous,  having  a
speciﬁc  gravity  of  1.05–1.10  and  a  hardness  of  2–2.5  on  the  Mohs
scale,  and  has  two  varieties  –  gray  and  yellow.  Amber  was  appreci-
ated and popular in antiquity for its beauty and its supposed magical
properties.  The  southeast  coast  of  the  Baltic  Sea  is  its  major  source
in  Europe,  with  lesser  sources  near  the  North  Sea  and  in  the  Medi-
terranean.  Amber  is  washed  up  by  the  sea.  There  is  evidence  of  a 
strong  trade  in  amber  up  the  Elbe,  Vistula,  Danube,  and  into  the 
Adriatic  Sea  area.  The  trade  began  in  the  Early  Bronze  Age  and
expanded  greatly  with  the  Mycenaeans  and  again  with  the  Iron 
Age  peoples  of  Italy.  The  Phoenicians  were  also  specialist  traders 
in  amber.  The  soft  material  was  sometimes  carved  for  beads  and 
necklaces.

Amersfoot interstadial: an interstadial of the Weichselian stage that has
radiocarbon dates between 68,000 and 65,000 bp, but it is possibly
earlier.

amorphous: having no deﬁnite form or distinct shape.
amphora: a large Greek or Roman earthenware storage jar, with a nar-
row neck and mouth and two handles (“two-eared,” each called an
anem) at the top. The body of the jar is usually oval and long, with
a pointed bottom. It was used for holding or transporting liquids, espe-
cially wine or oil, and other substances such as resin. Its shape made
it easy to handle and ideal for tying onto a mule’s or donkey’s back.
They  were  often  placed  side  by  side  in  upright  positions  in  a  sand-
ﬂoored cellar; sinking them into the sand or ground kept the contents
cool. Amphorae were also made of glass, onyx, gold, stone, and brass
and some had conventional jar bottoms with a ﬂat surface. The con-
tainer  would  be  sealed  when  full,  and  the  handle  usually  carried  an
amphora stamp, impressed before ﬁring, giving details such as the source,
the potter’s name, the date, and the capacity. Amphorae were prob-
ably not normally reused. [amphorae (pl.)]

ampulla: a small Greek or Roman globular ﬂask or bottle with two han-
dles and a short narrow neck. It was used for holding oil for bathers
(called ampulla oleria) or wine, oil, vinegar, and other beverages for
table use (then called ampulla potaria). These small containers were
usually the form of a globe or bladder, though sometimes shaped like
a lentil with rounded sides. [ampullae (pl.)]

amulet: small good-luck charms, often in the form of gods, hieroglyphs,
and sacred animals and made of precious stones or faience. They were
especially popular with Egyptians and other Eastern peoples, worn in
life and placed in burials or within mummy wrappings. Amulets were
supposed to afford protection and may have been thought to imbue the
wearer with particular qualities. Some superstitiously thought amulets

10

AMULET

could heal diseases or help the wearer avoid them. [meket, nehet, peri-
apta, sa, wedja]

amulet capsule: a case or container for an amulet.
amygdaloid: almond-shaped; a term used to describe elongated ovate or

cordiform biface tools.

anachronistic: pertaining to the representation of something as existing
or occurring at other than in its proper time, particularly earlier, and
involving or containing anything out of its proper time.

anaglyph:  a  term  describing  any  work  of  art  that  is  carved,  chased,
embossed, or sculptured – such as bas-reliefs, cameos, or other raised
working of a material. Materials which are incised or sunken are called
intaglios  or  diaglyphs.  The  Egyptians  also  used  the  term  anaglyphs
for a kind of secret writing.

analysis: a stage of archaeological research that involves describing and

classifying artifactual and nonartifactual data.

analytical type: arbitrary groupings that an archaeologist deﬁnes for clas-
sifying  artifacts;  groups  of  attributes  that  deﬁne  convenient  types  of
artifacts for comparing sites in space and time.

Anathermal: a period of cool climate in the area of North America that
occurred from about 7000 to 5000 bc. This was Ernst Antev’s name
for the ﬁrst of the Neothermal periods and it is thought to have started
off cool before becoming somewhat warmer.

ancestor bust: small, painted, apelike busts that were the focus of ancestor
worship in Egypt’s New Kingdom. Many were of limestone or sand-
stone, with some smaller examples made of wood and clay.

anchor: a heavy object used to moor a ship to the sea bottom, typically

having a metal shank with a pair of curved, barbed ﬂukes.

anchor ornament: an anchor-shaped, terra cotta object with a perforation
through the shank. These were widespread in the Early Bronze Age of
Greece and appear later in Sicily and Malta. Grooving, as if from thread
wear, suggests that these objects may have been part of looms.

Andean chronology: chronological systems of the Central Andes area with
two main stages, Preceramic and Ceramic. The Ceramic is broken down
into: Initial Period, 1900–1200 bc, Early Horizon 1200–300 bc, Early
Intermediate Period 300 bc to ad 700, Middle Horizon 700–1100, Late
Intermediate Period 1100–1438/1478, and Late Horizon 1438–1532.
These  Horizon  periods  are  times  of  widespread  unity  in  cultural
traits. Intermediate periods are times of cultural diversiﬁcation.

Andenne  ware:  a  medieval  glazed  ware  made  around  Andenne  on  the
River Meuse. The potters produced ordinary unglazed wares as well
as ﬁner pitchers and bowls. The glazed wares were widely traded in
western Europe from the late 11th century to the 14th century.

andesite: a dark, ﬁne-grained volcanic rock.

ANIMAL  STYLE

Anglian: quaternary glacial deposits found in East Anglia, England. Other
possibly  related  and  isolated  patches  exist  elsewhere  in  Britain,  but
they are older than the extreme range of radiocarbon dating and paleo-
magnetism shows them to be younger than 700,000 bp. This period
sometimes  equates  with  the  Elster  glacial  maximum  and  dates  to 
c. 400,000–300,000 years ago. During the Anglian-Elsterian glaciation
in Europe a large ice-dammed lake formed in the North Sea, and large
overﬂows  from  it  initiated  the  cutting  of  the  Dover  Straits.  In  East
Anglia, the deposits are stratiﬁed below Hoxnian and above Cromerian
interglacial deposits, and Acheulian and Clactonian artifacts are found
in the sediments. Most of the evidence of human activity in Britain and
Europe is later than this time. Anglian is more often used to describe the
group of deposits or the one glaciation (antepenultimate) of that time.
angon: a long spear with a double barb where one barb is longer than

the other.

aniconic: a seal bearing no image.
animal bell: a bell worn by an animal, e.g., sheep, goats, cows and hawks,

to inform the owner of the animal’s position.

animal style: a term describing a type of gold production whose themes
were  animals  and  which  arose  from  the  Scythians,  a  seminomadic 
people from the Eurasian steppes who moved from southern Russia
into  the  territory  between  the  Don  and  the  Danube  and  then  into
Mesopotamia. During the 5th to 4th centuries bc, this style appeared
on  shaped,  pierced  plaques  made  of  gold  and  silver,  which  showed
running or ﬁghting animals (reindeer, lions, tigers, horses) alone or in
pairs facing each other. The animal style had a strong inﬂuence in west-
ern  Asia  during  the  7th  century  bc.  Ornaments  such  as  necklaces,
bracelets, pectorals, diadems, and earrings making up the Ziwiye trea-
sure (found in Iran near the border of Azerbaijan) show evidence of
highly expressive animal forms. This Central Asian Scythian–Iranian
style passed by way of Phoenician trading in the 8th century bc into
the  Mediterranean  and  into  Western  jewelry.  The  most  popular
themes are antlered stags, ibexes, felines, birds of prey and, above all,
the animal-combat motif, which shows a predator, usually bird or feline,
attacking a herbivore. The joining of different animals and the use of
tiny animal ﬁgures to decorate the body of an animal are also char-
acteristic.  Animal  bodies  were  also  contorted  –  animals  curved  into
circles and quadrupeds with hindquarters inverted. The term is short-
hand for this complex of motifs and treatments, which for long periods
represented the art of the vast steppe zone of Europe and Asia. The
transformations  they  underwent  in  the  course  of  their  long  history 
on  the  steppes  often  leave  the  sources  and  afﬁliations  of  particular 
versions obscure.

12

ANKH

ankh:  Egyptian  hieroglyphic  sign  for  life,  consisting  of  a  T-shape  sur-
mounted  by  a  loop.  It  represents  a  sandal  strap  or  the  handle  of  a
mirror.  The  ankh  is  commonly  shown  being  carried  by  deities  and
pharaohs and was widely used as an amulet. Temple reliefs frequently
included  scenes  in  which  a  king  was  offered  the  ankh  by  the  gods,
thus  symbolizing  the  divine  conferral  of  eternal  life.  It  was  used  in
some personal names, such as Tutankhamen. It was adapted by Coptic
Christians as their cross.

anklet: an ornamental chain worn around the ankle.
annealing: the treating of a metal or alloy with heat and then cold – or
the  repeated  process  of  heating  and  hammering  to  produce  the
desired shape. After casting metal, it may be necessary to further pro-
cess it by cold working, hammering, and drawing the metal – either
to  produce  hard  cutting  edges  or  to  produce  beaten  sheet  metal.
Hammering makes the metal harder, though more brittle and subject
to cracking, because it destroys its crystalline structure. Annealing, the
reheating of the metal gently to a dull red heat and allowing it to cool,
produces a new crystalline structure which can be hammered again.
The process may be repeated as often as is necessary. The ﬁnal edge
on a weapon may be left unannealed as it will be harder and last longer.

annular: ring-shaped.
annular  ring  nail:  a  nail  with  sharp-edged  ridges  that  lock  into  wood

ﬁbers and greatly increase its holding power.

ansa:  Latin  term  for  handle  or  anything  handlelike,  such  as  an  eyelet,
haft,  or  hole.  Any  vessel  or  vase  with  large  ears  or  circular  handles
on the neck or body is said to have ansae. [ansae (pl.)]

ansa lunata: a handle or handles on a vessel or vase going in two oppo-
site  directions  or  in  two  diverging  projects.  The  term  describes
Terramara pottery of the Apennine culture and vessels of central Europe
of the Middle to Late Bronze Age.

anteﬁx:  ornamental  tiles  ﬁxed  to  the  eaves  and  cornices  of  ancient
Greek  and  Roman  buildings  to  decoratively  conceal  the  ends  of  the
rain  tiles.  The  term  also  refers  to  vertical  ornamental  heads  of  ani-
mals, etc. that were the spouts from the gutters. [anteﬁxal (adj.)]

anterior scar height: bivalve measurement.
anthropoid:  of  human  form;  manlike.  Taken  from  the  Greek  term  for
man-shaped,  it  is  used  to  describe  sarcophagi  and  cofﬁns  and  other
artifacts  of  human  shape.  The  term  is  also  used  to  describe  a  being
that  is  only  human  in  form  or  an  anthropoid  ape  (gibbons,  orangs,
chimpanzees, gorillas). [anthropomorphous]

anthropomorph: a representation of the human form in art, such as those
found  on  ancient  pottery;  ﬁgure,  object,  or  rock  art  with  or  using 
a  human  shape.  The  term  also  refers  to  the  attribution  of  human 

APULIAN  POTTERY

13

features and behaviors to animals, inanimate objects, or natural phe-
nomena.  [anthropomorphic  ﬁgure;  anthropomorphism  (n.);  anthro-
pomorphous (adj.)]

anthropomorphic:  manlike;  used  to  describe  artifacts  or  art  work 
decorated  with  human  features  or  with  a  manlike  appearance.
[anthropomorphous]

antimony: a brittle metallic substance that has been used in the prepara-
tion of yellow pigments for enamel and porcelain painting. It forms
a fourth constituent in alloys, along with nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic,
bismuth, and some others in forming triads and pentads.

antler: lowest, forward branch of the horn of a deer – bonelike mater-
ial  that  is  grown  and  shed  annually.  Antlers  indicate  the  sex  of  the
species, for example only male red deer, fallow deer, and elk (moose)
have antlers. They may also indicate whether a site is occupied sea-
sonally as they are naturally shed in the winter, except for female rein-
deer that shed their antlers in spring. Antlers were a valuable material
for making many tools.

antler sleeve: a section of deer antler carved into a cavity or hole at one
end to hold a stone axhead. The piece was either set into a socket in
a  haft  or  perforated  to  attach  to  the  haft.  This  material  was  used 
for  its  resilience  and  shock-absorbing  value  in  toolmaking.  Roughly
trimmed antler picks have been used in construction and ﬂint mining.
anvil: a block, usually of iron, upon which objects are shaped and ham-

mered, e.g., in smithing.

anvil stone: a stone on which other stones or materials (such as food)

are placed and crushed with a stone tool.

anvil technique: a prehistoric method of making chipped stone tools that
involves  striking  a  stone  repeatedly  against  a  static  boulder  used  as
an anvil. [anvil ﬂaking]

aplastics: intentional or accidental inclusions in pottery clays before ﬁring;
particulate matter in a clay body that does not contribute to plastic-
ity or that reduces the plasticity of the clay. [aplastic, temper]

apothecary jar: a jar used to store medicines, drugs, or the constituent

apotropaic:  of  statues,  etc.,  supposedly  having  the  power  to  avert  evil

parts of medicines and drugs.

inﬂuences or bad luck.

appliqué:  decoration  or  ornament  applied  to  or  laid  on  another  mate-
rial, such as metal on wood or embroidery on cloth; a ceramic ﬁnish-
ing technique that involves joining shaped pieces of a plastic body to
a  leather-hard  surface  by  pressure.  The  applied  pieces  can  be  func-
tional (e.g., handles) or decorative (e.g., ﬁgures).

Apulian  pottery:  an  important  type  of  south  Italian  pottery,  mostly 
decorated  in  the  red-ﬁgured  technique.  Production  seems  to  have

14

APULIAN  POTTERY

started  in  the  late  5th  century  bc and  may  have  been  inﬂuenced  by
Athenian pottery. One of the early centers may have been Tarentum.
In the middle of the 4th century the scenes became more ornate with
additional ﬁgures inserted in the ﬁeld and an increased use of added
colors. Plain wares were also produced.

aquamanile: used for holding water and washing hands, usually in the

arc style: an early style of Celtic art in which compass-drawn geomet-

shape of an animal.

ric motifs predominate.

archaeological chronology: establishment of the temporal sequences of
human cultures by the application of a variety of dating methods to
cultural remains.

archaic, Archaic: a term used to describe an early stage in the develop-
ment of civilization. In New World chronology, it is the period just
before  the  shift  from  hunting,  gathering,  and  ﬁshing  to  agricultural
cultivation, pottery development, and village settlement. Initially, the
term was used to designate a nonceramic-using, nonagricultural, and
nonsedentary  way  of  life.  Archaeologists  now  realize,  however,  that
ceramics, agriculture, and sedentism are all found, in speciﬁc settings,
within  contexts  that  are  clearly  archaic  but  that  these  activities  are
subsidiary to the collection of wild foods. In Old World chronology,
the  term  is  applied  to  certain  early  periods  in  the  history  of  some 
civilizations. In Greece, it describes the rise of civilization from c. 750 bc
to the Persian invasion in 480 bc. In Egypt, it covers the ﬁrst two dynast-
ies, c. 3200–2800 bc. In Classical archaeology, the term is often used
to  refer  to  the  period  of  the  8th  to  6th  centuries  bc.  The  term  was
coined for certain cultures of the eastern North America Woodlands
dating from c. 8000 to 1000 bc, but usage has been extended to vari-
ous  unrelated  cultures  that  show  a  similar  level  of  development  but
at widely different times. For example, it describes a group of cultures
in the eastern US and Canada that developed from the original migra-
tion  of  man  from  Asia  during  the  Pleistocene,  between  40,000  and
20,000 bc, whose economy was based on hunting, ﬁshing, and shell
and plant gathering. Between 8000 and 1000 bc, a series of technical
achievements  characterized  the  tradition,  which  can  be  broken  into
periods:  Early  Archaic  8000–5000 bc,  with  a  mixture  of  Big  Game
Hunting tradition with Early Archaic cultures, also marked by post-
glacial  climatic  change  in  association  with  the  disappearance  of  late
Pleistocene big game animals; Middle Archaic tradition cultures from
5000  to  2000 bc;  and  a  Late  Archaic  period  2000–1000 bc.  In  the
New  World,  the  lifestyle  lacked  horticulture,  domesticated  animals,
and permanent villages.

ARMLET

15

archaic  majolica:  a  series  of  jugs  and  bowls  of  the  early  13th  to  late
16th centuries in Tuscan and Italian towns. They were decorated with
geometric motifs, leaves, and other forms outlined in brown and set
into green or brown backgrounds. They were sold as far apart as Spain,
North Africa, and northern Europe. There seems to be a connection
to earlier Byzantine and Persian products. [archaic maiolica]

archaistic: imitatively archaic; affectedly and deliberately antique.
ard: an ancient light plow with a simple blade that was used to scratch
the  surface  of  the  soil  rather  than  turn  furrows.  It  was  drawn  by 
animals or people and grooved the ground, but it had no mold board
or  colter  and  therefore  did  not  turn  over  the  soil.  With  this  type  of
plow cross-plowing was usually necessary, with a second plowing at
right angles to the ﬁrst.

Ardagh  Chalice:  a  large,  two-handled  silver  cup  decorated  with  gold,
gilt  bronze,  and  enamel,  that  is  one  of  the  ﬁnest  examples  of  early
Christian art from the British Isles. Discovered in 1868, along with a
small bronze cup and four brooches in a potato ﬁeld in Ardagh, Ireland,
the chalice may have been part of the buried loot from a monastery
after an Irish or Viking raid. The outside of the bowl is engraved with
the  Latin  names  of  some  of  the  Apostles.  There  are  similarities
between the letters of the inscription and some of the large initials in
the Lindisfarne Gospels, which probably dates from about ad 710 to
720. Thus, the Ardagh Chalice is thought to date from the ﬁrst half
of the 8th century. The chalice displays exceptional artistic and tech-
nical skills applied to a variety of precious materials. So far, its manu-
facture  has  not  been  attributed  to  a  particular  workshop  but  the 
chalice  does  have  similarities  to  the  celebrated  Tara  brooch  and  the
Moylough belt-reliquary. It is now housed in the National Museum
of Ireland at Dublin.

Arezzo vase: red-clay Arretine pottery of which many ﬁne examples have
been found in or near the town of Arezzo in Tuscany, an important
Etruscan city. The red-lustered ware was ornamented in relief and shows
evidence of Greek origin.

argillite: a compact metamorphic rock formed from siltstone, shale, or
claystone and intermediate in structure between shale and slate. It is
cemented by silica but has no slaty cleavage.

Argonne ware: pottery type of the 4th century ad, usually red. Vessels
are decorated with horizontal bands of impressed geometric patterns,
executed  with  a  roller  stamp.  The  ware  was  made  in  the  Argonne,
northeast Gaul. [Marne ware]

armlet:  a  band  or  bracelet  worn  round  the  upper  part  of  a  person’s 

arm.

16

ARMOR

armor: protective clothing with the ability to deﬂect or absorb arrows,
bullets,  lances,  swords,  or  other  weapons  during  combat.  There  are
three main types: (1) armor made of leather, fabric, or mixed mater-
ials reinforced by quilting or felt; (2) mail of interwoven rings of iron
or steel; and (3) rigid armor of metal, plastic, horn, wood, or other
tough  material,  including  plate  armor  of  the  Middle  Ages’  knights.
Armor was used well before historical records were kept by primitive
warriors. The ﬁrst was likely made of leather hides and included hel-
mets. It was found that in the 11th century bc, Chinese warriors wore
ﬁve to seven layers of rhinoceros skin. Greek heavy infantry wore thick,
multilayered linen cuirasses in the 5th century bc. Armor is found along
with  arrows,  clubs,  hammers,  hatchets,  and  other  weaponry  and  is
often  ornamented.  The  defensive  armor,  shield,  and  thorax  were
called hopla, and people wearing them were called hoplites. [armour,
arms, body armor]

Armorican ax: rather plain and shoddily made type of socketed bronze
ax produced in the period 650–600 bc at the very end of the Bronze
Age of northern France (Hallstatt II). Mostly found in large hoards,
in which few examples appear to have been ﬁnished or used. This has
led to the suggestion that they were somehow connected with emer-
gency trade in metal rather than ﬁnished products.

Armorican coin: collective name for coinage issued by a range of tribes

living in Brittany, France during the early 1st century bc.

Armorico-British dagger: type of bronze dagger found in the Wessex I
phase of the Early Bronze Age (c. 1700–1500 bc) in southern Britain.
It has a ﬂat triangular blade, lateral grooves, six rivets for attaching
the blade to the hilt, and sometimes a small tang or languette to assist
securing the blade to the hilt. Traces of wooden and leather sheaths
have been found with some blades; the hilts were probably of wood.
[Breton dagger]

Arretine ware: a type of bright red, polished pottery originally made at
Arretium (modern Arezzo) in Tuscany from the 1st century bc to the
3rd century ad. The term means literally “ware made of clay impressed
with designs.” The ware was produced to be traded, especially through-
out  the  Roman  Empire.  It  is  clearly  based  on  metal  prototypes  and
the body of the ware was generally cast in a mold. Relief designs were
also cast in molds which had been impressed with stamps in the desired
patterns and then applied to the vessels. The quality of the pottery was
high, considering its mass production. However, there was a gradual
roughness to the forms and decoration over the four centuries of pro-
duction. After the decline of Arretium production, terra sigillata was
made in Gaul from the 1st century ad at La Graufesenque (now Millau)
and later at other centers in Gaul. Examples have come from Belgic tombs

ARTIFACT

17

in  pre-Roman  Britain  and  from  the  port  of  Arikamedu  in  southern
India. The style changes and the potters’ marks stamped on the vessels
make these wares a valuable means of dating the other archaeological
material found with them.

arris:  sharp  ridge  or  edge  formed  by  the  junction  of  two  smooth  sur-
faces, especially on the midrib of a dagger or sword, or in moldings.
[arris, arrises (pl.)]

arrow:  a  weapon  consisting  of  a  stick  with  a  sharp  pointed  head,

designed to be shot from a bow.

arrow straightener: a stone with a regular, straight groove on one face.
It is thought to have been used to smooth wooden shafts of arrows,
so the name is misleading. [arrowshaft straightener]

arrowhead: a small object of bone, metal, or stone that has been formed
as the pointed end of an arrow for penetration and is often found at
sites of prehistoric peoples. The earliest known are Solutrean points
of the Upper Paleolithic. Arrowheads are often the only evidence of
archery since the arrow shaft and bow rarely survive. The term pro-
jectile point is generally preferable because it avoids an inference regard-
ing  the  method  of  hafting  and  propulsion.  Most  often,  arrowheads
were placed in a slot in the shaft, tied, and then ﬁxed with resin. [arrow-
head, projectile point]

articular surface: portion of a bone connecting with other bones.
artifact: any object (article, building, container, device, dwelling, orna-
ment,  pottery,  tool,  weapon,  work  of  art)  made,  affected,  used,  or
modiﬁed in some way by human beings. It may range from a coarse
stone or a needle to a pyramid or a highly technical accomplishment
– these objects are used to characterize or identify a people, culture,
or stage of development. The most common artifacts are pieces of bro-
ken pottery, stone chips, projectile points, and tools. The environment
may  play  a  part  in  the  nature  of  an  artifact  if  it  has  been  seriously

18

ARTIFACT

altered by people through ﬁre, house and road construction, agricul-
tural  practices,  etc.  Therefore,  the  line  is  sometimes  hard  to  draw
between a natural object and one used by man, but there is no doubt
when it can be shown that people shaped it in any way, even if only
accidentally in the course of use. Artifacts are individually assignable
to  ceramic,  lithic,  metal,  or  organic,  or  other  lesser  used  categories.
A  sociotechnic  artifact  is  a  tool  that  is  used  primarily  in  the  social
realm.  A  technomic  artifact  is  a  tool  that  is  used  primarily  to  deal
with the physical environment. [artefact]

artifact type: a description of a category of artifacts that share a set of
somewhat variable attributes, such as spoons or tables; a population
of artifacts that share a recurring range and combination of attributes.
[artefact type]

artifact  typology:  placement  of  materials  in  a  geographic,  temporal, 
etc.  context  with  other  similar  artifacts;  the  study  of  artifact  classes
with common characteristics; classiﬁcation according to artifact type.
[artefact typology]

Arundel  marbles:  a  collection  of  marbles  and  ancient  statues  taken 
from Greece and Asia Minor at the expense of Thomas Howard, Earl
of  Arundel  (1585–1646)  and  given  to  Oxford  University  in  1667, 
which  came  to  be  known  as  the  Arundel  (or  Oxford)  marbles.
[Oxford marbles]

aryballos: term for a small Greek vase or a large Inca pottery jar. The
Greek  ﬂask  was  one-handled,  normally  globular  (quasispherical  or 
pear-shaped), with a narrowing neck. It was used mostly for oil, per-
fume, unguent, or condiments and stood about 5–8 cm (2–3 inches)
high. Aryballos were originally made at Corinth from about 575 bc.
There  were  painted  patterns  on  them  until  550 bc and  sometimes 
patterns were engraved. From the Greek for “bag” or “purse.” The
Inca  version  was  a  large  jar  with  a  conical  base,  tall  narrow  neck, 
and ﬂaring rim. It was used for carrying liquids, designed to be car-
ried on the back by a rope which passed through two strap handles
low on the jar’s body and over a nubbin at the base of the jar neck.
[aryballus]

arystichos: a Greek or Roman vessel for drawing water, especially from

amphorae. [arusane, arustis, aruter, ephebos, oinerusis]

as: a small Roman bronze coin, four of which made a sestertius and 16

made a denarius.

askos: an assymetrical vessel, often squat and duck-shaped, with an off-
center mouth, convex top, and single arching handle. It was originally
shaped like a leather bottle (uter) for holding water, oil, or wine. Some
examples  have  two  mouths,  one  for  ﬁlling  and  one  for  emptying, 
and  others  are  quite  unbalanced  and  have  strange  mouths.  It  later

ASUKA

19

assumed the form of an earthenware pitcher. Askos were popular in
the Aegean from the Early Helladic to the Classical period. From the
Greek for “bag.”

assemblage: a group of objects of different or similar types found in close
association with each other and thus considered to be the product of
one people from one period of time. Where the assemblage is frequently
repeated  and  covers  a  reasonably  full  range  of  human  activity,  it  is
described  as  a  culture;  where  it  is  repeated  but  limited  in  content, 
e.g., ﬂint tools only (a set of objects in one medium), it is called an 
industry.  When  a  group  of  industries  are  found  together  in  a  single
archaeological  context,  it  is  called  an  assemblage.  Such  a  group 
characterizes  a  certain  culture,  era,  site,  or  phase  and  it  is  the  sum 
of all subassemblages. Assemblage examples are artifacts from a site 
or feature.

assertive style: any style with only vague associations with social iden-
tity, such as a tendency to wear certain types of clothing or jewelry.
association:  co-occurrence  of  two  or  more  objects  sharing  the  same 
general  location  and  stratigraphic  level,  that  are  thought  to  have 
been  deposited  at  approximately  the  same  time  (being  in  or  on  the
same  matrix).  Objects  are  said  to  be  in  association  with  each  other
when they are found together in a context that suggests simultaneous
deposition.  Associations  between  objects  are  the  basis  for  relative 
dating  or  chronology,  and  the  concept  of  cross-dating  as  well  as  in
interpretation – cultural connections, original function, etc. of pottery
and ﬂint tools associated in a closed context – would be grounds for
linking  them  into  an  assemblage,  possibly  making  the  full  material 
culture of a group available. The association of undated objects with
artifacts of known date allows the one to be dated by the other. When
two or more objects are found together and it can be proved that they
were deposited together, they are said to be in genuine or closed associ-
ation. Examples of closed associations are those within a single inter-
ment grave, the material within a destruction level, or a hoard. An open
association  is  one  in  which  this  can  only  be  assumed,  not  proved.
Artifacts may be found next to each other and still not be associated;
one of the artifacts may be intrusive.

astrolabe: an instrument, usually consisting of a disk and pointer, formerly
used to make astronomical measurements, especially of the altitudes
of celestial bodies and as an aid in navigation.

Asuka: a culture and period in Japanese history during which the develop-
ment of art, the introduction of Buddhism from Korea, and the adop-
tion of a Chinese pattern of government were important. Located in
the southwestern part of the Nara Basin (Yamato Plain), the culture
ﬂourished from ad 552 to 645. In art history, the Asuka culture refers

20

ASUKA

to  early  Buddhist  art  and  architecture  in  the  northern  Wei  style.  In
chronology,  the  Asuka  period  refers  more  to  the  reign  of  the  Soga 
family  during  which  Buddhism  was  promoted  and  a  formal  admin-
istrative  structure  with  diplomatic  relations  was  introduced.  Many 
old temples and palaces are or contain surviving examples of Asuka
architecture, sculpture, and paintings.

Athenian pottery: pottery produced in Athens from the Late Geometric
period of monumental craters and amphorae through the Hellenistic
period.  The  best  known  are  the  ﬁgure-decorated  potteries  of  the
Archaic and Classical periods that were widely exported along with
plain wares.

Atlantic period: in Europe, a climatic optimum following the last Ice Age.
This  period  was  represented  as  a  maximum  of  temperature,  and 
evidence from beetles suggests it being warmer than average for the
interglacial. It seems to have begun about 6000 bc, when the average
temperature rose. Melting ice sheets ultimately submerged nearly half
of western Europe, creating the bays and inlets along the Atlantic coast
that  provided  a  new,  rich  ecosystem  for  human  subsistence.  The
Atlantic period was followed by the Sub-Boreal period. The Atlantic
period, which succeeded the Boreal, was probably wetter and certainly
somewhat  warmer,  and  mixed  forests  of  oak,  elm,  common  lime 
(linden), and elder spread northward. Only in the late Atlantic period
did beech and hornbeam spread into western and central Europe from
the southeast.

atlatl: a New World version of a spear-throwing device, used by the Aztecs
and other peoples of the Americas. It consisted of a wooden shaft used
to  propel  a  spear  or  dart  and  it  functioned  like  an  extension  of  the
arm, providing more thrusting leverage. Atlatl weights are objects of
stone fastened to the throwing stick for added
weight.  These  may  be  perforated  so  that  the
stick passes through the artifact, or they may
be grooved for lashing to the stick. In western North America it was
the main hunting weapon from about 6500 bc until ad 500. [atl-atl,
spear thrower]

atlatl weight: drilled or grooved stone or shell that was used to weight

the atlatl. [atl-atl weight]

attapulgite:  one  of  several  hydrous  magnesian  clays  with  a  lathlike  or

ﬁbrous particle shape, characterized by a chainlike structure.

Attic black-ﬁgure ware: type of pottery made in the Attica region of south-
ern Greece from about 720 bc. Vase painters developed a character-
istic style of decoration in which one or more friezes of human and
animal ﬁgures are presented in silhouette in black against a red back-

ground. The delineation of the ﬁgures is sometimes heightened by the
use of incised lines and the addition of white or purple color.

attribute: a distinct, individual characteristic of an artifact that cannot
be  further  subdivided  and  distinguishes  it  from  another;  a  logically
irreducible character, such as length. An attribute is used to classify
artifacts into groups and describes objects in terms of their physical
traits  such  as  color,  design  pattern,  form,  shape,  size,  style,  surface
texture, technology, and weight. Attribute analysis is a method of using
these characteristics to statistically produce clusters of attributes in iden-
tifying classes of artifacts. [attribute state]

attribute value: particular value associated with an attribute of an item,

e.g., “brown” as the attribute value of “attribute, color.”

auger: a tool used to probe into the ground and extract a small sample
of a deposit without performing actual excavation. Its applications in
archaeology are as a means of sampling and understanding the geo-
logical  environment  of  a  site  and  also  for  extracting  peat  for  pollen
analysis.  There  are  various  types  of  augers  and  they  can  be  manual
or power driven. Simple augers bring up samples on the thread of a
drill bit. More elaborate ones open a chamber to collect a core after
the  drill  has  bored  to  an  appropriate  depth.  Augering  is  generally
restricted to the earliest stages of archaeological reconnaissance to deter-
mine the depth and characteristics of deposits.

aureus:  a  gold  coin  that  was  a  unit  of  currency  in  the  Roman  Empire

between 30 bc and 310 ad.

auricle:  the  corners  of  a  stem  of  stemmed  arrowhead  types  or  the 

corners of the base of triangular types that are earlike.

auriculate: a major projectile form which has rounded or pointed ears

that project from the concave base or stem of points or blades.

Aurignacian:  a  series  of  Upper  Paleolithic  cultures  in  Europe  that
existed  from  about  35,000  to  20,000  years  ago  (dates  also  given  as
38,000–22,000  years  ago).  They  were  characterized  by  their  use  of
stone (ﬂint) and bone tools, the reﬁnement of those tools, and the devel-
opment of sculpture and cave painting. The culture is named for the 
type site Aurignac, in southern France, where such artifacts were dis-
covered.  In  France  it  is  stratiﬁed  between  the  Châtelperronian  and 
the Gravettian (and before the Solutrean and the Magdalenian), but
industries of Aurignacian type are also found eastwards to the Balkans,
Palestine, Iran, and Afghanistan. At Abri Pataud there is a radiocarbon
date of before 31,000 bc for the Aurignacian, but there are possibly
earlier  occurrences  in  central  and  southeast  Europe  (Istállóskö  in
Hungary, Bacho Kiro in Bulgaria). There is still considerable dispute
about the extent to which the Aurignacian is contemporary with the

22

AURIGNACIAN

cultures of the Perigordian group in southwest France. The sites are
often in deep, sheltered valleys. Split-based bone points, carinates (steep-
end scrapers), and Aurignac blades (with heavy marginal retouch) are
typical of the Aurignacian. Aurignacian is also important as the most
distinctive and abundantly represented of the early Upper Paleolithic
groups.

authentic: not counterfeit or copied.
Avonlea point: early bow and arrow projectile point dated ad 100–500,

from North Dakota.

awl: a small tool consisting of a thin, tapering, sharp-pointed blade of
bone, ﬂint, or metal used for piercing holes, making decorations, or
in assisting basketweaving. [bodkin, piercer, pricker]

ax: one of the last major categories of stone tool to be invented, around
the end of the last Ice Age in the Paleolithic. It is a ﬂat, heavy cutting
tool  of  stone  or  metal  (bronze)  in  which  the  cutting  edge  is  parallel
to the haft and which might have the head and handle in one piece.
Its main function was for woodworking (hewing, cleaving, or chop-
ping trees) but it was also used as a weapon of war, as the battle ax.
There are many forms of ax, depending on the different materials and
methods of hafting. The word ax is now used instead of celt. Hand
ax is used to denote the earlier implement which was not hafted. In
Mesolithic times, stone axes were usually chipped from a block of ﬂint,
and could be resharpened by the removal of a ﬂake from the end. In
the Neolithic, axes were polished and often perforated to aid hafting.

Bronze Age Looped Palstave Ax

AYAMPITIN  POINT 23

Axes  are  now  usually  made  of  iron  with  a  steel  edge  or  blade  and
ﬁxed  by  means  of  a  socket  in  the  handle.  Smaller,  lighter  ones  are
called hatchets. [axe]

ax hammer: a tool consisting of an ax and a hammer combined, i.e., a
shaft-hole ax having a hammer knob in addition. It was primarily a
weapon of war, combining the functions of battle ax and mace. [axe
hammer, axe-adze, hammer axe]

ax trimming ﬂake: characteristic waste ﬂakes struck off in the produc-

axhead: cutting or chopping part of an ax. [axehead]
axhead  roughout:  an  unﬁnished,  roughly  shaped  axhead.  [axehead

tion of axes.

roughout]

axis of detachment: path of the force that removed a piece from the core
of a stone tool, running from the point of impact on the platform of
the artifact toward the distal end.

axis of ﬂaking: an imaginary line drawn roughly down the middle of a
lithic ﬂake as viewed from the dorsal side and extending from the point
of percussion, parallel to the direction of striking or the line of force
during striking.

axle: a rod or spindle, either ﬁxed or rotating, on which a wheel or group
of wheels is ﬁxed. The axle cap is usually made of iron; it bound the
end of an axle and was perforated to allow a linch pin to pass through
the axle and keep the wheel in place.

Ayampitin  point:  bifacially  worked  stone  tips  of  willowleaf  outline
found among Archaic hunter-gatherer communities of the Peruvian high-
lands and coasts in 9000–7000 bc.

B

B ware: ceramic amphorae of the east Mediterranean, from the 1st to

the early 7th century ad and divided into four subgroups.

bacini: pottery vessels ranging in date from the 11th to 15th centuries
and found in northern Italy, especially in medieval churches. They were
placed  in  walls  of  churches,  over  church  doorways,  and  in  church 
towers  for  decorative  purposes.  These  Italian  vessels  were  imported
from the Byzantine and Arabic world, but later Italian majolicas were
made  as  bacini.  Bacini  were  probably  also  used  in  southern  Italian,
Greek, and western European churches. Some were painted and incised;
some were monochromic, while others had fantastic designs.

backed blade: in stone toolmaking, a small blade with one edge blunted
by  further  chipping  along  one  edge.  This  retouching  technique  was
used so that it could be ﬁtted snugly into a haft, to provide a ﬁnger-
rest, or so that it could be held in the hand without cutting the ﬁngers.
[backed knife]

backed bladelet: a small stone blade with one edge blunted.
backed ﬂake: a purposely created stone ﬂake tool which is usually a decor-
tication ﬂake that retains a piece of the cortex on one side and a sharp
edge on the other.

backing: 1. A type of steep retouch probably used to dull the edge of a
ﬂake, making it suitable for hafting or handling with ﬁngers; common
on the edge opposite the cutting edge of a knife. 2. Pertaining to enamel
or pottery.

backplate: plate armor protecting the back; worn as part of a cuirass.
backstrap: a simple loom known in pre-Columbian America and in Asia
and still used in western Mexico, Guatemala, and other places in Central
America.  A  continuous  warp  thread  passes  between  two  horizontal

BAIKAL  NEOLITHIC

25

poles,  one  attached  to  a  support  and  the  other  to  a  seated  weaver,
who  adjusts  the  tension  by  moving  forwards  or  backwards.  The
Navajo  Indians  wove  blankets  on  a  two-bar  loom  for  centuries.
Throughout the Caroline Islands (except Palau), strips of banana and
hibiscus ﬁber are woven on backstrap looms.

badge:  a  distinguishing  emblem  or  mark,  often  worn  to  signify  mem-

bership, achievement, employment, etc.

Badorf ware: a type of pottery of the 8th to 9th centuries from the hills
of  Cologne,  Germany.  The  globular  pitchers  and  bowls  of  the
Carolingian period are the best known. Badorf-ware kilns have been
excavated at Bruhl-Eckdorf and Walberberg and products have been
found  in  the  Netherlands,  eastern  England,  and  in  Denmark.  In  the
9th century, the pots began to be decorated with red paint. Gradually
new forms and styles known as Pingsdorf wares evolved.

bag: a ﬂexible container with an opening at one end.
bag wear: damage that can occur to artifacts and ecofacts during excava-

tion, transportation, and cataloging.

Baikal Neolithic: Neolithic period of the Lake Baikal region in eastern
Siberia.  Stratiﬁed  sites  in  the  area  show  a  long,  gradual  move  from
the Paleolithic to Neolithic stage, starting in the 4th millennium bc.
The  postglacial  culture  was  not  “true”  Neolithic  in  that  it  farmed, 
but  was  Neolithic  in  the  sense  of  using  pottery.  It  was  actually  a
Mongoloid  hunting  and  ﬁshing  culture  (except  in  southern  Siberia
around  the  Aral  Sea)  with  a  microlithic  ﬂint  industry  with  polished
stone  blade  tools  together  with  antler,  bone,  and  ivory  artifacts,
pointed- or round-based pottery, and the bow and arrow. Points and
scrapers made from ﬂakes of Mousterian ﬂakes and pebble tools dis-
playing the ancient chopping tool tradition of eastern Asia have also
been  found.  There  was  a  woodworking  and  quartzite  industry  and 
some  cattle  breeding.  The  ﬁrst  bronzes  of  the  region  are  related  to 
the Shang period of northern China and the earliest Ordos bronzes.
The area covers the mountainous regions from Lake Baikal to the Paciﬁc
Ocean and the taiga (coniferous forest) and tundra of northern Siberia.
A ﬁrst stage is named for the site Isakovo and is known only from a
small number of burials in cemeteries. The succeeding Serovo stage is
also known mainly from burials with the addition of the compound
bow backed with bone plates. The third phase, named Kitoi, has buri-
als with red ocher and composite ﬁsh hooks that possibly indicate more
ﬁshing. The succeeding Glazkovo phase of the 2nd millennium bc saw
the beginnings of metal-using, but generally showed continuity in arti-
fact and burial types. Some remains of semi-subterranean dwellings with
centrally located hearths occur, together with female statuettes in bone.

BALANCE

balance: an apparatus for weighing, usually consists of a beam on a pivot
with a means of supporting the object to be weighed on one side and
weights on the other.

ball: a round object used in games. [game ball]
ball clay: a ﬁne-textured, highly plastic sedimentary clay, usually com-
posed  of  the  mineral  kaolinite,  typically  containing  considerable
organic matter and ﬁring white or cream. [ball-clay]

ballista:  an  ancient  heavy  missile  launcher  designed  to  hurl  javelins  or
heavy balls on the principle of a crossbow. The smaller ballista was
just  that  –  a  basic,  large  crossbow  fastened  to  a  mount.  It  was  also
used  to  hurl  iron  shafts,  Greek  ﬁre,  heavy  darts,  etc.  during  sieges.
The  huge,  complicated  Roman  ballista,  however,  was  powered  by 
torsion derived from two thick skeins of twisted cords through which
were  thrust  two  separate  arms  joined  at  their  ends  by  the  cord  that
propelled the missile. The largest ballistas were quite accurate in hurl-
ing  27 kg  (60-pound)  weights  up  to  about  450 m  (500  yards).  The
catapult was yet another machine used for ﬁring bolts and other arrow-
like missiles. The two terms are often used interchangeably. [balista]
baluster jug: a general type of tall medieval jug used in Europe whose

height is about three times its diameter.

band: a design element or fundamental part that is continued or repeated
along  a  straight  line  that,  on  pottery,  most  commonly  encircles  the
vessel but may also be vertical or diagonal.

Bandkeramik: a pottery of the Danubian I culture, a Neolithic culture
that existed over large areas of Europe north and west of the Danube
River  around  the  5th  millennium  bc.  It  consists  of  hemispherical 
bowls and globular jars, usually round-based and strongly suggesting
copies of gourds. The name refers speciﬁcally to the standard incised
linear  decoration  –  pairs  of  parallel  lines  forming  spirals,  meanders,
chevrons, etc. There was farming of emmer wheat and barley and the
keeping of domestic animals such as cattle. The most common stone
tool was a polished stone adze. The people lived in large rectangular
houses  in  medium-sized  village  communities  or  in  small,  dispersed 
clusters. [LBK, Linearbandkeramik, Linienbandkeramik (German)]

Bann ﬂake: a type of leaf-shaped ﬂake found widely amongst the later
Mesolithic assemblages of Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man, and
a  component  of  the  Bann  culture.  These  are  large  ﬂakes  having  no
signiﬁcant tang, with light retouch, either as elongated or laminar forms
or as broader leaf-shaped forms with only very peripheral retouch at
the bottom. [Bann point]

bannerstone: a stone atlatl – a throwing-stick weight – put on the shaft
to give great propulsion to a thrown dart. The stone is perforated for

hafting and often has a bipennate, “butterﬂy” or bannerlike appear-
ance. [banner stone, birdstone, boatstone]

Banshan: site of a Neolithic cemetery in the Tao River valley of China,
the  type  site  of  the  Banshan  (or  Pan-shan)  culture  which  belongs  to
the western or Gansu branch of the Yangshao Neolithic. Banshan is
best known for its painted pottery ﬁrst found in a grave in 1923. Pan-
shan ware is generally considered to date between 2500 and 2000 bc,
but it may extend as far back as 3000 bc or be as late as c. 1500 bc
(the  Shang  dynasty).  Most  are  unglazed  pottery  urns  or  reddish
brown with painted designs in black and brown, probably applied with
a brush, consisting of geometric patterns or stylized ﬁgures of people,
ﬁsh,  or  birds.  The  wares  were  probably  shaped  on  a  slow  or  hand-
turned wheel. The handles are set low on the body of the urns, and
the  lower  part  of  the  body  is  left  undecorated  –  much  like  Greek
Protogeometric  funerary  ware.  It  was  an  important  ﬁnd  because  of
the lack of Neolithic Chinese pottery up to 1923. A late stage of Banshan
is named after the site of Machang. [Pan-shan]

bar  hammer  technique:  a  stone-ﬂaking  technique  using  a  bone,  antler,
wood, or other relatively soft material as a hammer to remove small,
ﬂat ﬂakes from a core during ﬂint knapping. These ﬂakes have a char-
acteristically long, thin form with a diffuse bulb of percussion. [cylinder
hammer technique, soft hammer technique]

bar iron: a piece of iron cut from blooms and lengths of bar, probably

for transportation, which were then reworked.

barb:  a  subsidiary  point  facing  away  from  the  main  point  that  makes

an arrowhead or spear hard to remove. [barbed (adj.)]

barbed and tanged arrowhead: triangular-shaped ﬂint arrowheads of the
later Neolithic and Early Bronze Age in Europe. They are distinctive
in having a short rectangular tang on the base opposite the point, sym-
metrically  set  either  side  of  which  is  a  barb.  The  tang  was  used  to
secure  the  arrow  tip  to  its  shaft  and  usually  projects  slightly  below
the ends of the barbs.

barbed dowel pin: a wooden pin used to align parts, act as a pivot, or

permit disassembly or separation.

barbed point: a bone or antler point with rows of barbs, usually on one

barbed wire: strong wire with barbs at regular intervals used to prevent

side only.

passage.

barbotine: a technique of decorating pottery by adding thick slip to the
surface of a pot before ﬁring. The term also refers to the creamy mix-
ture of kaolin clay itself, for pottery ornamented with barbotine, and
the technique of applying an incrustation of this mixture to a ceramic

28

BARBOTINE

surface for decorative effect. The slip was not applied evenly, but in
order to form a thick incrustation in patches or trails. On certain types
of  pottery,  such  as  the  Nene  Valley  ware,  the  barbotine  decoration
may form a picture or a pattern. Sometimes the result is simply a rough-
ened surface, rather like icing upon a cake. The method was particu-
larly popular in Roman Gaul and Britain. [barbotine decoration]

bar-gorget: a barlike ornament, usually of polished stone and perforated,

worn around the throat.

barrel: a cylindrical container, often of wood, that holds liquids.
barrel  urn:  type  of  large  Middle  Bronze  Age  pot  found  within  the
Deverel-Rimbury  ceramic  tradition  of  southern  Britain  c.  1500 bc
through to 1200 bc. Barrel urns have a distinctive proﬁle, wider in the
middle than at the base or the rim, often with applied cordons that
are  decorated  with  ﬁngertip  impressions.  They  were  used  as  storage
vessels and as containers for cremations.

bar-shaped ingot: ﬂat rectangular ingots of silver of Roman times in Britain.
basal edge: proximal edge of a triangular or lanceolate projectile or stem
of a stemmed type. There are eight major types of basal edges: con-
vex,  straight,  concave,  auriculate,  lobbed,  bifurcated,  fractured,  and
snapped.

basal grinding: the grinding of projectile points at their base and lower
edges (so that the lashings will not be cut), a Paleoindian cultural prac-
tice.  Basal  thinning  obtains  the  same  result  through  the  removal  of
small chips instead of grinding. [basal notching]

basal notch: a ﬂaking technique applied to accommodate hafting, which

involved the ﬂaking of notches into the basal edge of a preform.

basal thinning: intentional removal of small, longitudinal ﬂakes from the
base of a chipped stone projectile point or knife to facilitate hafting.
basal-looped  spearhead:  type  of  leaf-shaped  socketed  spearhead  of  the
European Middle Bronze Age which has two small holes or loops at
the base of the blade, one either side of the socket – possibly for secur-
ing the metal spearhead to the wooden shaft or to tie streamers to the
top of the spear.

basalt:  a  type  of  very  hard,  dark,  dense  rock,  igneous  in  origin,  com-
posed  of  augite  or  hornblende  and  containing  titaniferous  magnetic
iron  and  crystals  of  feldspar.  It  often  lies  in  columnar  strata,  as  at 
the Giant’s Causeway in Ireland and Fingal’s Cave in the Hebrides. It
is greenish- or brownish-black and much like lava in appearance. It is
also abundant in Egypt and Greece.

base:  1.  Proximal  or  end  portion  of  a  knife,  tool,  or  projectile  point.
The base is usually designed for hafting or gripping, but not designed
or  intended  for  cutting,  scraping,  or  penetrating.  Oftentimes,  base 
edges were ground so that sharp edges would not abrade the hafting

BAS-RELIEF

29

materials  and  cause  hafting  failure  with  use.  2.  Lower  portion  of  a
vessel from the lower boundary of the body to the place that would
normally  be  in  contact  with  the  surface  on  which  the  vessel  rested,
sometimes a foot or tripod.

baselard: a type of dagger, usually used by civilians in the medieval period,

with an H-shaped hilt.

baseward ﬂaking: the removal of ﬂakes from the distal tip at a down-

ward angle towards the basal edge.

basket: a container that is usually woven and may have handles.

Egyptian basket, New Kingdom, 1411–1375 BC

Basketmaker  tradition:  Late  Archaic  and  Post-Archaic  sedentary  com-
munities  living  in  southwestern  parts  of  North  America  between  c.
1000 bc and ad 750  with  three  main  phases.  Basketmaker  Phase  I,
dated  to  c.  1000–1 bc,  is  essentially  the  same  as  the  Archaic.
Basketmaker Phase II, c. ad 1–450, is the same as the Desert Archaic
and represents the beginning of a long-lived cultural tradition on the
Colorado  Plateau,  which  is  referred  to  as  the  Anasazi.  Basketmaker
Phase  III,  c.  ad 450–750  equates  to  a  developed  phase  of  Anasazi,
when beans were added to the diet and there was a greater commit-
ment to agriculture.

basketry: a class of artifacts created by the practice of weaving containers
from vegetable ﬁbers, twigs, or leaves. It was known in Mexico before
7000 bc and  in  Oregon  before  8000 bc,  and  the  earliest  recorded 
examples  in  the  Old  World  are  from  Fayum  in  Egypt,  c.  5200 bc.
However,  taking  into  consideration  the  perishability  of  basketry,
these  may  be  comparatively  late  in  the  history  of  the  technique.
Basketry is not preserved in the same quantities as pottery and stone
vessels. [cordage]

bas-relief: a low-relief technique of sculpture or carved work in which
the  ﬁgures  project  less  than  half  of  their  true  proportions  from  the
surface on which they are carved. The term also describes sculptures
or carvings in low relief. Mezzo-relievo means projecting exactly half;
alto-relievo more than half. [basso-relievo, low relief, low-relief]

30

BASSE-YUTZ

Basse-Yutz:  bronze  wine  ﬂagons  found  in  Moselle,  France,  with  coral
and enamel inlay, from c. 400 bc. The pair is thought to have come
from a Celtic chieftain’s grave.

bat: a slab, disk, or board of plaster, ﬁred clay, asbestos, or other slightly
porous material used to dry a wet clay body by absorbing moisture from
it, as a support in shaping an object from the clay, or as a detachable
wheel head. [batt]

baton: a soft hammer used to strike ﬂakes from a stone core, often made

of antler, bone, or wood. [billet, percussor]

bâton de commandement: a name given to perforated batons made of
antler  rod  of  the  Upper  Paleolithic  period  in  western  Europe,  from
the Aurignacian period (30,000 years ago) through the Magdalenian.
They  have  a  hole  through  the  thickest  part  of  the  head,  are  usually
30 cm (12 inches) long, but are often broken. The perforation is smooth
and round, and highly decorated examples come from the Magdalenian
culture. Their use is unknown.

baton perce: an Upper Paleolithic artifact, occasionally encountered in
Aurignacian, Gravettian, and Solutrean assemblages but more typically
found  in  Magdalenian  toolkits.  It  consists  of  a  decorated  cylinder 
of  antler  with  a  hole  through  the  thickest  part.  The  baton  may  be 
decorated with intricate carving. Its function is unknown, although it
is generally interpreted as a shaft straightener, from the use-wear in
and around the hole. [perforated baton]

battering-ram: an ancient military engine used for smashing in doors and
battering down walls. It consisted of a beam of wood with a head of
iron – originally a ram’s head but later in the form of a ram’s head
–  and  swung  by  chains  from  an  overhead  scaffolding.  It  had  a  roof
to protect those working it from the missiles of the garrison.

Battersea Shield: a Late Iron Age parade shield found in the River Thames
at Battersea, England. It is a ﬁne example of insular Celtic art, with
an elongated bronze body with rounded ends and decorated in relief
and with red glass inlay.

battle ax: a type of prehistoric stone weapon, designed as a weapon of
war. It is always of the shaft-hole variety, and frequently has a ham-
mer, knob, or point at the opposite end from the cutting edge. In stone,
they  are  common  throughout  most  of  Europe  in  the  Late  Neolithic
and  Copper  Age,  and  are  often  associated  with  Corded  ware  and
beakers.  (The  term  Battle-ax  culture  is  often  used  as  a  synonym  for
Corded  ware  or  Single  Grave  culture.)  Further  east,  more  elaborate
ones  of  copper  or  gold  were  more  ceremonial  than  functional.  The
Vikings  made  iron  battle  axes  and  used  them  well  into  the  Middle
Ages.  The  pole  ax  is  distinguished  from  the  battle  ax  by  a  spike  on
the back of the ax. [battle-axe, battleaxe]

BEACHARRA  WARE

31

Bayeux  Tapestry:  a  medieval  embroidery  depicting  the  Norman  Con-
quest of England in 1066, which is considered a remarkable work of
art  and  important  as  a  source  for  11th-century  history.  It  consists 
of a roll of unbleached linen worked in colored worsted with illustra-
tions and is about 70 m (75 yards) long and 50 cm (20 inches) deep.
The work was probably commissioned by Bishop Odo of Bayeux, a
half-brother of William the Conquerer, and took about 2 years to com-
plete. It was likely ﬁnished no later than 1092. The tapestry depicts
the events leading up to the invasion of England by William Duke of
Normandy and the Battle of Hastings on October 14, 1066, when the
English King Harold was defeated and killed. Though not proven, the
tapestry appears to have been designed and embroidered in England.
The themes are enacted much like that of a feudal drama or chanson
de geste. The technical detail and iconography of the Bayeux Tapestry
are of great importance. For instance, the 33 buildings depicted offer
a look at the contemporary churches, castles, towers, and motte and
bailey  castles.  The  battle  scenes  give  details  on  infantry  and  cavalry
formations, Norman armor and weapons, and the clothing and hair-
styles of the time. The invasion ﬂeet consists of Viking double-enders
(clinker-built  long  boats,  propelled  by  oars  and  a  single  mast).  The
tapestry  was  discovered  in  the  nave  of  Bayeux  Cathedral  in  France 
by  French  antiquarian  and  scholar  Bernard  de  Montfaucon,  who
published the earliest complete reproduction of it in 1730. It narrowly
escaped  destruction  during  the  French  Revolution,  was  exhibited  in
Paris  at  Napoleon’s  wish  in  1803–04,  and  thereafter  has  been  kept
in the Bayeux public library.

bayonet: a blade adapted to ﬁt the muzzle end of a riﬂe and used as a

weapon in close combat.

BC: an abbreviation used to denote so many years before Christ or before
the beginning of the Christian calendar. The lower case “bc” repres-
ents uncalibrated radiocarbon years; the capitals bc denote a calibrated
radiocarbon  date,  or  a  date  such  as  a  historically  derived  one,  that
does  not  need  calibration.  There  is  no  year  0:  1 bc is  followed  by
ad 1.

BCE: an abbreviation used to denote so many years before the common
era  or  before  the  Christian  era.  Dates  are  often  listed  as bce (= bc)
and ce (common  era  or  Christian  era  = ad).  In  the  Gregorian 
calendar, eras are designated bce and ce, terms which are equivalent
to bc (before Christ) and ad (Latin: anno Domini).

Beacharra ware: type of decorated Middle Neolithic pottery of western
parts of Scotland. The ware is classiﬁed into three groups: (1) unor-
namented,  bag-shaped  bowls;  (2)  decorated,  carinated  bowls  with  a
rim diameter less than the diameter at the carination and with incised

Beads

BEACHARRA  WARE

or channeled ornament; and (3) small bowls with panel ornament in
ﬁne whipped cord.

bead: a small, circular, tubular, or oblong ornament with a perforated

center; usually made from shell, stone, bone, or glass.

bead rim: a rim in the form of a small, rounded molding, in section at
least  two-thirds  of  a  circle.  It  was  often  used  on  bowls,  dishes,  and
jars. [beaded rim]

beadwork: decorative work made of beads.
beaker: a simple pottery drinking vessel without handles, more deep than
wide, much used in prehistoric Europe. The pottery was usually red
or brown burnished ware, decorated with horizontal panels of comb-
or  cord-impressed  designs.  It  was  distributed  in  Europe  from  Spain 
to Poland, and from Italy to Scotland in the years after 2500 bc; the
international bell beaker is particularly widespread, though uncommon
in Britain. In Britain there are local variants: the long-necked (formerly
A) beakers of eastern England and the short-necked (formerly C) beakers
of  Scotland.  There  were  local  developments  elsewhere,  such  as  the
Veluwe beakers in the Netherlands. Beaker vessels are commonly found
in graves, which were often single inhumations under round barrows;
commonly  associated  ﬁnds  include  copper  or  bronze  daggers  and 
ornaments, ﬂint arrowheads, stone wristguards, and stone battle axes.
In  many  northern  and  western  areas  its  users  were  the  ﬁrst  to  start
copper  metallurgy.  The  widespread  distribution  of  beaker  ﬁnds  has
led to the frequent identiﬁcation of a Beaker people and speculations
about their origins.

beater: 1. In music, a wooden or metal object used to provide a rhythm
by striking another object. 2. A general tool used to beat objects with.
beating: a technique to thin and even out the walls of coil- or slab-built
vessels after they have partially hardened to “leather” hardness, to improve
the bonding between coils, or add surface texture. One holds an anvil
or ﬁst inside the vessel while the outside is struck repeatedly with a
paddle, which can be wrapped with cord or fabric to add texture to the
vessel surface. [beater-and-anvil, hammer-and-anvil technique, paddling]
bec:  a  Paleolithic  ﬂake-boring  tool  that  was  retouched  on  one  edge  to

form a point.

beehive quern: type of rotary quern of Roman times with an extremely

thick dome-shaped upper stone and a slightly ﬂared base.

Belgic pottery: general term sometimes applied to the range of Late Iron
Age  wheel-turned  pottery  vessels  found  in  southeastern  England,
especially Aylesford-Swarling pottery.

bell: the earliest bell founding (i.e., the casting of bells from molten metal)
is associated with the Bronze Age. The ancient Chinese were superb
founders, their craft reaching an apex during the Zhou/Chou dynasty

BENBEN  STONE

33

(c.  1122–221 bc).  Characteristic  were  elliptical  temple  bells  with
exquisite symbolic decorations cast onto their surfaces by the cire per-
due  or  lost  wax  process.  Bells  had  an  important  ceremonial  role  in
ancient  China  during  the  Zhou/Chou  dynasty.  The  earliest  Chinese
bells, of the Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1123 bc), were mounted mouth
upwards and struck. Later bells hung mouth downwards.

bell beaker, Bell Beaker: a type of pottery vessel found all over western
and central Europe from the Final Neolithic or Chalcolithic, c. 2500–
1800 bc. The culture’s name derives from the characteristic pottery,
which looks like an inverted bell with globular body and ﬂaring rim.
The beakers were valuable and highly decorated. They are often asso-
ciated with special artifacts in grave assemblages, including polished
stone wristguards, V-perforated buttons, and copper-tanged daggers.
bell glass: a bell-shaped glass cover used, especially formerly, as a cloche.
bellarmine: a capacious round-bellied jug or pitcher bearing a grotesque
human mask. Originally created in the Netherlands as a burlesque like-
ness of Cardinal Bellarmine, the idea spread widely and the term later
became applied to any jug bearing a human mask.

bellows: an object used to create a blast of air.
belt: a strip of leather or other material worn round the waist to sup-

port or hold in clothes or to carry weapons.

belt hook: small decorative and functional object used as a garment hook
in China, Korea, and other Near Eastern areas as early as the 7th cen-
tury bc. Belt hooks have been found in Han tombs in southwestern
China,  but  this  luxury  item  was  most  in  vogue  during  the  Warring
States period (5th to 3rd centuries bc). These belt hooks were inlaid
with gold or silver foil, polished fragments of turquoise, or more rarely
with  jade  or  glass;  sometimes  they  were  gilded.  Most  examples  are
bronze,  often  lavishly  decorated  with  inlays,  but  some  are  made  of
jade, gold, or iron. The belt hook consists of a bar or ﬂat strip curv-
ing into a hook at one end and carrying at the other end, on the back,
a  button  for  securing  it  to  the  belt.  The  hooks  vary  widely  in  size,
shape, and design, and although contemporary sculptures sometimes
show them at the waists of human ﬁgures, some examples are far too
large to have been worn and their function is unclear. Textual evid-
ence  hints  that  the  belt  hook  was  adopted  by  the  Chinese  from 
the mounted nomads of the northern frontier of inner Asia, perhaps
along with other articles of the horseman’s costume. They were prob-
ably worn by both men and women. [toggle]

benben  stone:  a  cult  object  made  of  stone,  found  at  sites  such  as  the 
one  for  the  sun  god  Re  at  Heliopolis.  The  sacred  stone  symbolized
the Primeval Mound and perhaps also the petriﬁed semen of the deity.
It  served  as  the  earliest  prototype  for  the  obelisk  and  possibly  even

34

BENBEN  STONE

the pyramid. It was probably constructed in the early Old Kingdom,
c. 2600 bc.

bending: a detached piece produced by cracks initiated away from the
point  of  applied  force.  These  ﬂakes  usually  have  a  pronounced  lip,
contracting lateral margins immediately below the striking platform,
and no bulb of force.

Benton ﬂaking: this ﬂaking technique involved the removal of large and
small  percussion  ﬂakes,  which  resulted  in  numerous  step  fractures.
Pressure ﬂaking was often used to form serrations. Oblique-transverse
ﬂaking was used to shape the blade of a few examples.

bentonites: a clay formed by the decomposition of volcanic ash, having
the ability to absorb large quantities of water and to expand to several
times its normal volume.

Benty Grange helmet: an Anglo-Saxon ceremonial helmet found in 1848
at a burial site in Benty Grange. Unlike the Sutton Hoo helmet, which
has  similarities  to  Swedish  helmets,  the  Benty  Grange  example  was
undoubtedly  of  native  workmanship.  It  is  an  elaborate  object  com-
bining the pagan boar symbol with Christian crosses on the nail heads.
betyl: a sacred stone, often a standing stone fashioned into a conical shape.
bevel: a surface or edge which slopes away from a horizontal or vertical
surface; the angle or inclination of a line or surface that meets another
at any angle but 90°. [beveled (adj.)]

beveled-rim  bowl:  a  widespread,  crudely  made  conical  pottery  vessel
formed in a mold and having a sloped rim, characteristic of the late
Uruk period.

Bewcastle  Cross:  a  runic  standing  cross  monument  in  the  churchyard 
of  Bewcastle,  Northumberland,  northern  England,  dating  from  the 
late 7th or early 8th century. Although the top of the cross has been
lost,  the  4.5 m  (15-foot)  shaft  remains,  with  distinct  panels  of  the 
ﬁgures  of  Christ  in  Majesty,  St.  John  the  Baptist,  and  St.  John  the
Evangelist,  while  on  the  back  there  is  an  inhabited  vinescroll.  Like 
the Ruthwell Cross, that at Bewcastle possesses a poem inscribed in
runic  script.  The  worn  inscription  suggests  that  the  monument  was 
a  memorial  to  Alchfrith,  son  of  Oswiu  of  Northumbria,  and  his 
wife Cyneburh (Cyniburug). It is one of the ﬁnest examples of early
Christian Northumbrian art.

bi disk: a ﬂat jade disk with a small hole in the center, made in ancient
China for ceremonial purposes, possibly symbolizing heaven. Bi disks
have also been described in ancient Chinese texts as a symbol of rank.
Jade disks and disklike axes have been found in 4th and 3rd millen-
nium bc graves  at  east-coast  Neolithic  sites  such  as  Beiyinyangying.
Polished stone disk segments are known still earlier at Banpo. [bi]

bichrome ware: pottery having a two-color design or decoration.

BIFACIAL  CORE

35

biconical:  pertaining  to  a  vessel  when  the  sides  make  a  sharp,  inward
change of direction, as if two truncated cones were placed base to base.
biconical drilling: a means of perforating beads or pendants for suspension.
Accomplished by drilling in from both sides with a tapered drill result-
ing in an hourglass-shaped hole.

biconical urn: style of Early Bronze Age pot of northwestern Europe with
a  deep,  largely  plain,  outwardly  ﬂared  body.  Above  that  is  a  sharp
carination, decorated and sometimes with an applied cordon, and an
inwardly  angled  neck  with  impressed  cord  designs.  The  rim  is  typ-
ically beveled and lightly ornamented.

biconvex: a blade shape having two worked faces.
bier:  a  movable  wooden  platform  on  which  corpses  were  laid,  some-
times  together  with  grave  goods,  and  eventually  carried  to  a  burial
place.

biface: a type of prehistoric stone tool ﬂaked on both faces or sides; the
main tool of Homo erectus. The technique was typical of the hand-
ax  tradition  of  the  Lower  Paleolithic  period  and  the  Acheulian  cul-
tures. Bifaces may be oval, triangular, or almond-shaped in form and
characterized by axial symmetry, even if the marks made by use are
more plentiful on one face or on one edge. The cutting edge could be
straight or jagged and the tool used as a pick, knife, scraper, or even
weapon. Only in the most primitive tools was ﬂaking done to one side
only. [bifacial, coup-de-poing, hand ax]

biface bevel: a bevel that was formed by removing ﬂakes from both faces

of an edge.

biface bevel ﬂaking: this ﬂaking technique involved the removal of elong-
ate, steep, pressure or percussion ﬂakes just opposite each other from
an edge to form a biface bevel and often biface serrations.

biface serration ﬂaking: this ﬂaking technique involved the removal of
elongate, not so steep, pressure or percussion ﬂakes just opposite each
other from an edge to form biface serrations.

biface thinning ﬂake: a ﬂake that has been removed from a biface through
percussion  as  part  of  the  reduction  process.  These  ﬂakes  typically 
were removed from an unﬁnished biface (or blank) in order to make
it thinner.

bifacial: on both ventral and dorsal sides.
bifacial blank: a biface in the early stages of production displaying only
percussion ﬂaking and no evidence of pressure ﬂaking. In many cases,
blanks were traded and/or transported from their area of origin and
subsequently  used  as  bifacial  cores  from  which  ﬂake  blanks  were
detached for the production of dart or arrow points.

bifacial  core:  a  core  that  has  had  ﬂakes  removed  from  multiple  faces;

may be mistaken for a large biface blank.

36

BIFACIAL  FLAKING

bifacial ﬂaking: manufacture of a stone artifact by removing ﬂakes from

both faces.

bifacial foliate: a class of artifact comprised of leaf-shaped stone tools

with complete or nearly complete ﬂaking on both sides.

bifacial  retouch:  retouch  ﬂaking  that  occurs  on  both  the  ventral  and 

dorsal sides of an edge.

bifacial  thinning  ﬂake:  ﬂakes  removed  during  the  thinning  or  resharp-
ening of bifaces. These ﬂakes are relatively ﬂat, have broad, shallow
ﬂake  scars  (produced  by  the  detachment  of  previous  thinning  ﬂakes
from the dorsal face), and tend to exhibit a feathering out of lateral
margins. The proximal end of the ﬂake often retains the edge of the
biface  and,  if  the  platform  is  retained,  it  often  exhibits  a  low  angle
and evidence of crushing or grinding (i.e., platform preparation).

bifacially worked: pertaining to an artifact that has been ﬂaked on both

sides. [bifacial working (n.)]

biﬁd razor: type of tool, possibly a razor, of the Middle Bronze Age of
Europe, with two ovate, sharp-edged lobes of thin metal attached to
a central tang.

bifurcate: point base split into double lobes with indentation similar to

notches on the sides. [bifurcated base]

Big Horn Medicine Wheel: a medicine wheel in the Big Horn Mountains
of Wyoming that consists of a D-shaped stone cairn from which 28
individual stone spokes radiate. The outer circumference has six smaller
cairns. The feature may be astronomically aligned.

bilaterally  barbed:  a  projectile  point  or  harpoon  with  barbs  on  both 

edges.

bilaterally symmetrical: the condition in which, when something is cut
down the middle, the two halves formed are generally mirror images
of each other.

bill hook: a tool used to cut or split wood.
billet: a soft hammer used to strike ﬂakes from a stone core, often made

of antler, bone, or wood. [baton, percussor]

binder: a substance, usually organic, added to a clay or glaze to increase

its green strength.

bipennis: an ax with a double blade or edge, used as an agricultural imple-
ment,  an  adze,  or  a  military  weapon.  It  was  used  by  the  Amazons,
Scythians, and Gauls. [bipenne]

bipoint: a bone or stone artifact pointed at both ends.
bipolar percussion: a type of percussion that involves the placement of
raw material (usually small rounded or oval cobbles) on an anvil stone
and striking it from the top. [bipolar ﬂaking, bipolar technique]

bipolar  reduction:  producing  lithic  ﬂakes  and  debris  by  placing  a 
core on an anvil and striking it from above with a large hammer to
shatter it.

BIVALVE  MOLD

37

birch-bark  manuscript:  early  Russian  letters  and  documents  scratched
onto  thin  pieces  of  birch  bark,  dating  to  the  11th  to  15th  centuries
ad.  They  were  ﬁrst  found  in  1951  in  Novgorod  by  A.  Artsikhovski
and form a very important source of information as no other docu-
ments earlier than the 13th century have survived because of frequent
ﬁres  in  the  wooden  cities  of  Old  Russia.  The  manuscripts  are  quite
well preserved from layers of organic materials. [birch-bark beresty]
birdpoint: a smaller arrowhead used by Native Americans to kill small

game such as rabbit, waterfowl, and birds. [bird point]

birdstone: a class of prehistoric stone objects of undetermined purpose,
usually  resembling  or  shaped  like  a  bird;  carved  bird  efﬁgies.  These
polished stone weights occurred in the cultures of the Archaic tradi-
tion (8000–1000 bc) and later cultures in the eastern woodlands of
North  America.  They  were  probably  attached  to  throwing  sticks  or
atlatls to add weight and leverage. [bannerstone, bird-stone, boatstone]

Birdstone

biscuit:  pots  that  have  been  given  a  preliminary  ﬁring  to  render  them
hard  enough  for  further  work  such  as  decoration  and  glazing.  The
higher the temperature of the biscuit ﬁring, the harder will be the pot,
resulting in a reduced reaction between the glaze and body in the ﬁnal
ﬁring.  Also  includes  unglazed  ﬁred  pottery,  awaiting  glazing,  which
is then glazed and reﬁred in the glost ﬁring. [bisque, bisque ﬁring]

bit,  horse:  a  metal  mouthpiece  attached  to  a  bridle,  used  to  control  a
horse.  The  domesticated  horse  was  probably  ﬁrst  controlled  with  a
simple  halter.  The  bit  consists  of  a  bit-mouth  and  adjacent  parts  to
which the reins are attached. Bits with cheekpieces of antler did not
appear in central Europe until after 1800 bc and they were later replaced
by bronze bits. Bits without a cheek-piece, in two- or three-piece form,
were introduced in the Iron Age.

bivalve: an aquatic mollusk that has a compressed body enclosed within
two hinged shells, such as an oyster, mussel, or scallop, or any animal
with two halves to its shell such as an ostracode or brachiopod.

bivalve mold: in metalworking, a form of mold with two halves pegged
together  and  used  for  casting  metal  objects.  The  mold  can  be  made
of clay, metal, or stone. The mold is parted to release the cast object

38

BIVALVE  MOLD

once  the  metal  has  cooled.  It  is  a  reusable  mold  more  complicated
than an open mold.

Black-and-Red  ware:  any  Indian  pottery  with  black  rims  and  interior
and red on the outside, due to ﬁring in the inverted position, which
was made beginning in the Iron Age. Characteristic forms include shal-
low dishes and deeper bowls. It ﬁrst appeared on late sites of the Indus
civilization and was a standard feature of the Banas culture. This ware
has been found throughout much of the Indian peninsula with dates
of the later 2nd and early 1st millennium bc. In the 1st millennium it
became widespread in association with iron and megalithic monuments.
In the Ganges Valley it post-dates ocher-colored pottery and generally
precedes painted gray ware. [Black and Red ware]

Black-burnished ware: culinary vessel forms made in two different fabrics
and  widely  imitated.  One  was  black,  gritty,  and  handmade  from 
c. ad 120  to  the  late  4th  century  ad.  A  second  was  more  gray  and
ﬁner, with a silvery ﬁnish, and wheel-thrown in the Thames Estuary
area c. ad 140 to the mid 3rd century ad. [black burnished ware]

black-ﬁgure:  a  type  of  Greek  pottery  that  originated  in  Corinth 
c. 700 bc and was popular until red-ﬁgure pottery, its inverse, began
in c. 530 bc. This style consisted of pottery with one or more bands
of human and animal ﬁgures silhouetted in black against the tan or
red ground. The red color was probably taken when the pot was ﬁred.
The delineation of the ﬁgures was often heightened by the use of incised
lines  and  the  addition  of  white  or  purple  coloring.  The  ﬁgures  and
ornamentation  were  drawn  on  the  natural  clay  surface  of  a  vase  in
glossy black pigment; the ﬁnishing details were incised into the black.
The  ﬁrst  signiﬁcant  use  of  the  black-ﬁgure  technique  was  on  proto-
Corinthian-style pottery developed in Corinth in the ﬁrst half of the
7th century bc. The Corinthian painter’s primary ornamental device
was the animal frieze. The Athenians, who began to use the technique
at the end of the 7th century bc, retained the Corinthian use of animal
friezes  for  decoration  until  c.  550 bc,  when  the  great  Attic  painters
developed  narrative  scene  decoration  and  perfected  the  black-ﬁgure
style. There were also studios producing black-ﬁgure ware in Sparta
and eastern Greece. [Black-ﬁgure ware; black-ﬁgured (adj.)]

black-glazed:  a  style  of  pottery  decoration  in  which  plain  wares  were
given a black sheen, which continued well into the Hellenistic period
– especially in Athens from the 6th to 2nd centuries bc. These wares
were often made alongside ﬁgure-decorated pottery and, from the 5th
century bc,  the  shapes  were  frequently  of  stamped  decoration. 
In the 4th century bc, rouletting was also used. [black-glossed]

blade: a long, narrow, sharp-edged, thin ﬂake of stone, used especially
as a tool in prehistoric times. This ﬂake was detached by striking from

BLADELET

Blades

a  prepared  core,  often  with  a  hammer.  Its  length  is  usually  at  least
twice the width. The blade may be a tool in itself, or may be the blank
from  which  a  two-edged  knife,  burin,  or  spokeshave  was  manufac-
tured. This term, then, is used by archaeologists in several ways. (1)
It can refer to a fragment of stone removed from a parent core. The
blade is used to manufacture artifacts in what is known as the blade
and core industry. (2) That portion of an artifact, usually a projectile
point or a knife, beyond the base or tang. (3) In certain cultures, small
artifacts are called microblades. It was a great technological advance
when  it  was  discovered  that  a  knapper  could  make  more  than  one
tool from a chunk of stone. The Châtelperronian and Aurignacian were
the earliest of the known blade cultures – associated with the arrival
of modern humans. Industries in which many of the tools are made
from  blades  became  prominent  at  the  start  of  the  Upper  Paleolithic
period.  A  typical  blade  has  parallel  sides  and  regular  scars  running
down  its  back  parallel  with  the  sides.  A  “backed  blade”  is  a  blade
with  one  edge  blunted  by  the  removal  of  tiny  ﬂakes.  Blades  led  to
another  invention  –  the  handle.  A  handle  made  it  easier  and  much
safer to manipulate a sharp, two-edged blade. [blade tool]

blade  core:  a  ﬂint  or  stone  core  from  which  blades  have  been  struck,
typically  conical  or  pyramidal  in  shape  and  producing  distinctive 
debitage.

blade tool: a tool made from a single, thin, narrow ﬂake detached from
a core. The controlled ﬂaking technique is characteristic of the Upper
Paleolithic but it is also known from earlier cultures.

bladelet: shorter, narrower blade.

40

BLANK

blank: a partly ﬁnished stone artifact that has been worked roughly into
a shape but which must be further chipped to a suitable size and form
to become a tool. This is an intermediate manufacturing stage in the
production of stone tools, where the tools are given the rough shape
at a quarry or workshop and often taken elsewhere for completion.
Blanks  were  presumably  made  in  quantity  because  they  were  easier
to carry from place to place than heavy lumps of stone.

Blattspitzen: a category of stone artifact with complete or nearly com-
plete ﬂaking on both sides and points at one or both ends. They are
found  in  some  late  Middle  and  early  Upper  Paleolithic  industries  of
central and eastern Europe.

block  statue:  a  type  of  sculpture  introduced  in  the  Middle  Kingdom
(2055–1650 bc), that represents the subject squatting on the ground
with knees drawn up close to the body, under the chin. The arms and
legs may be wholly contained within the simple cubic form, with the
hands and feet protruding discretely. The 12th dynasty block statue
of Sihathor in the British Museum is the earliest dated example. The
block statue of Queen Hetepheres, in the Egyptian Museum at Cairo,
is also one of the earliest examples of this type.

bloom: 1. Spongy mass of material made up of iron and slag, produced
from the initial smelting of iron ore. The slag and impurities are mostly
driven off in preliminary forging. To produce useful iron, bloom must
be hammered at red heat to expel the stone and add a proportion of
carbon  to  the  metal.  2.  A  mass  of  iron  after  having  undergone  the
ﬁrst hammering or an ingot of iron or steel, or a pile of puddled bars,
which has been passed through one set of “rolls,” made into a thick
bar, and left for further rolling when required for use.

blowpipe: a long, hollow tube used to blow molten glass into shapes.
Blue Willow pottery: ﬁrst made in England over 200 years ago, and said
to be “America’s favorite patterned ware.” Willow ware is available
in a wide range of patterns; the makers are most identiﬁable by marks,
styles, and periods, running from 1780 onward.

blunt: a point that abruptly terminates part way up the blade with no
true distal point for piercing. Typically the point is chipped in a mild
excurvate  or  straight  edge.  Some  feel  that  the  point  may  have  been
used in hunting as a “stunning” weapon. However, most blunts show
signs of being a conserved, former projectile, reworked into a hand-
held or hafted scraper.

boatmaking: boatmaking and navigation have been important for thou-
sands of years and there is evidence of dugout canoes from Mesolithic
times onward, the earliest being at Perth and in Denmark. Neolithic
people used skiffs as well as dugout canoes. Plank boats appeared in
the Middle Bronze Age. In the Roman period, boats started being made

BOLAS  STONE

with nails. Sea-going vessels existed, but there is not much evidence
except for skin boats, like the Irish curragh. Classical writers describe
plank-built boats with sails of leather on the Atlantic before the Romans
arrived. Full documentation begins only with the Vikings. The Americas
have yielded two regional pre-conquest types of craft: the reed cabal-
litos of the Peruvian coast and Lake Titicaca, and the sea-going balsa
rafts from the Gulf of Guayaquil.

boatstone: a boat-shaped stone atlatl – a throwing-stick weight – put on
the shaft to give great propulsion to a thrown dart. Unlike the banner-
stone, it was apparently lashed to the stick shaft. [bannerstone, birdstone]

Side

Boatstone

bobbin: an object on which thread or yarn is wound or hooked.
bodkin: 1. A sharp slender instrument for making holes or for other func-
tions. It may be shaped like a dagger, stiletto, or hairpin. 2. A blunt
needle with a large eye for drawing tape or ribbon through a loop or
hem.

body: 1. The main part of a vessel that contains the volume (or sherds
of it). 2. Clay or a mixture of clay and inclusions (temper) that is suit-
able  for  forming  vessels  or  that  has  been  ﬁred  into  a  vessel.  [fabric,
paste, ware]

body plug: an object used in the preparation of a body following death.

It was used to plug the oriﬁces of the body.
body shape: overall form of a ceramic object.
body sherd: any fragment of a ceramic vessel not identiﬁable as a rim

sherd. [body shard]

bolas  stone:  weighted  balls  of  stone,  bone,  ivory,  or  ceramic  that  are
either  grooved  or  pierced  for  fastening  to  rawhide  thongs  and  used
to hunt prey. The bolas, still found today among some of the peoples

42

BOLAS  STONE

of  South  America  and  among  the  Inuits,  usually  consists  of  two  or
more globular or pear-shaped stones attached to each other by long
thongs. They are whirled and thrown at running game, with the thongs
wrapping  themselves  around  the  limbs  of  the  animal  or  bird  on 
contact.  Bolas  stones  have  been  found  in  many  archaeological  sites
throughout  the  world,  including  Africa  in  Middle  and  Upper
Acheulian strata. [bola, bola stone, bolas; bolases (pl.)]

Bolling interstadial: an interstadial of the Weischselian cold period, dated

to between 13,000 and 12,000 bp.

bolt: an iron arrow or missile, especially stout and short with a blunt or
thickened head, discharged from a crossbow or other engine. [quarrel]
bombylos: a Greek or Roman vase so-called from the gurgling noise that

the liquid made when pouring out of the narrow neck. [bombyle]

Bondi  point:  a  small,  asymmetrically  backed  point,  named  for  Bondi,
Sydney, which is a component of the Australian Small Tool tradition.
It is usually less than 5 cm (2 inches) long and is sometimes described
as a backed blade. Some examples suggest that the points were set in
wooden handles or shafts. It occurs on coastal and inland sites across
Australia, usually south of the Tropic of Capricorn. The oldest exam-
ples come from southeast Australia, dating from about 3000 bc, and
the most recent are 300–500 years old. The Bondi point was not being
used by Aborigines when Europeans arrived.

bone:  connective  tissues  of  the  body,  consisting  of  crystallite  minerals
and  collagen.  After  death,  the  proteins  slowly  decompose  and  the
remaining mineral is subject to solution in acid soil conditions. Bones
are preserved on a wide variety of archaeological sites. From early pre-
history, the bones, horns, or antlers of animals that people hunted or
kept provided people with a vital source of raw material for constructing
artifacts. There are many types of bone. There are a variety of rela-
tive age-determination techniques applicable to bone material, includ-
ing measurements of the depletion of nitrogen (bone dating) and the
accumulation of ﬂuorine and uranium.

Bone Age: a loosely deﬁned prehistoric period of human culture char-
acterized by the use of implements made of bone and antler; not part
of the Three Age System.

bone  china:  white  porcelain  containing  the  mineral  residue  of  burnt 

bones.

bone hammer: a bone that is used as a hammer in the removal of ﬂakes

from a core in the manufacturing of stone tools.

Bonneville: a time in the late Pleistocene epoch about 30,000 years ago
when  a  prehistoric  lake  formed  covering  an  estimated  52,000 km2
(20,000 square miles), over much of western Utah and parts of Nevada
and Idaho in the US. These conditions existed during the interval of

the last major Pleistocene glaciation. Lake Bonneville shrank rapidly
in size and, by 12,000 years ago, had permanently shrunk to a point
where it had become smaller than Great Salt Lake.

boomerang:  a  curved  wooden  throwing  stick  with  a  biconvex  or 
semi-oval  cross-section,  distributed  widely  over  Australia  except  for
Tasmania,  and  used  for  hunting  and  warfare.  The  boomerang  had
marked  regional  variations  in  design  and  decoration.  Returning
boomerangs  are  used  in  Australia  as  playthings,  in  tournament 
competition,  and  by  hunters  to  imitate  hawks  for  driving  ﬂocks  of 
game  birds  into  nets  strung  from  trees.  The  returning  boomerang 
was  developed  from  the  nonreturning  types,  which  swerve  in  ﬂight.
Boomerangs  excavated  from  peat  deposits  in  Wyrie  Swamp,  South
Australia  have  been  dated  to  c.  8000 bc.  Boomerang-shaped,  non-
returning  weapons  were  used  by  the  ancient  Egyptians,  by  Indians 
of  California  and  Arizona,  and  in  southern  India  for  killing  birds, 
rabbits, and other animals.

Boreal: a climatic subdivision of the Holocene epoch, following the Pre-
Boreal  and  preceding  the  Atlantic  climatic  intervals.  Radiocarbon
dating shows the period beginning about 9500 years ago and ending
about 7500 years ago. The Boreal was supposed to be warm and dry.
In  Europe,  the  Early  Boreal  was  characterized  by  hazel–pine  forest
assemblages  and  lowering  sea  levels.  In  the  Late  Boreal,  hazel–oak 
forest assemblages were dominant, but the seas were rising. In some
areas,  notably  the  North  York  moors,  southern  Pennines,  and  low-
land heaths, Mesolithic man appears to have been responsible for tem-
porary clearances by ﬁre and initiated the growth of moor and heath
vegetation.

bored stone: a rounded stone of various sizes with a bored hole in the
middle, found in central and southern Africa and dating back 40,000
years. Some were used as weights on digging sticks.

borer: a ﬂint tool for piercing holes.
boshanlu: a Chinese incense burner (lu) with a lid designed to represent
mountain peaks, such as Boshan, a mountain in Shangdong province.
They are stemmed bowls of pottery or bronze with a perforated con-
ical lid. Most examples date from the western Han period. One from
the tomb of Liu sheng (dated 113 bc) at Mancheng is inlaid with gold.

boss: a stud on the center of a shield.
bossed bone plaque: objects of unknown function made from long animal
bones and carved with a row of bosses – circular, square, or oval orna-
mental motifs. Examples from Lerna, Troy, and Altamira date to the
late 3rd millennium bc. The ﬁnest have engraved decoration also. A
series from Castelluccio, Sicily, with outliers in Italy and Malta, are
curved in cross-section and are dated just before 2500 bc.

BOTTLE

bottle: a container, typically made of glass or plastic and with

a narrow neck, used for storing drinks or other liquids.

bottle kiln: a large kiln, wide at the bottom and narrow at the

top like a bottle.

Boufﬁoulx stoneware: the Boufﬁoulx region has been producing
ceramics for almost 500 years. Many artists contributed to
the revival of the Boufﬁoulx genre in the ﬁrst part of the 20th
century when producing hand-thrown stoneware artworks,
known today as the grès d’art of Boufﬁoulx.

boulder clay: a clayey deposit of an ice age that contains boulders; the

clay of a glacial or drift period.

boundary marker: an indicator of the extent of an area of land.
bout  coupé:  in  British  archaeology,  a  well-made  cordiform  or  subtri-
angular reﬁned biface from northwest Europe. It may be a diagnostic
Mousterian tool.

bow: an offensive weapon for shooting arrows or missiles and used in
hunting and war. It generally consists of a strip of bendable wood or
other material with a string stretched between its two ends. The arrow
or missile is shot by the recoil after retraction of the string. The weapon
was  ﬁrst  used  in  the  Upper  Paleolithic  by  the  Gravettians.  Some
Mesolithic examples have been preserved in peat bogs, but often all
that remains is an arrowhead or wrist guard.

bow and arrow: weapon consisting of two parts. The bow is made of
a strip of ﬂexible material, such as wood, with a cord linking the two
ends of the strip to form a tension from which is propelled the arrow.
The arrow is a straight shaft with a sharp point on one end and usually
with feathers attached to the other end.

bow brooch: any brooch with the pin sprung or hinged at one end and
the catch-plate at the other end of a curved or ﬂat bow. It can be a
one- or two-piece construction.
bowl: a round, deep dish or basin.
box: a container with a ﬂat base and sides and usually a lid.
box  ﬂue:  a  brick  of  four  terra  cotta  tiles  that  were  joined  together  to
conduct the furnace-heated air of a Roman (hypocaust) heating system.
The tiles were joined at the edges and open at the top and the bottom.
The air was directed through them up the walls to escape at the eaves.
The exposed faces of the box-ﬂue tiles were often decorated in relief
to provide a key for the wall plaster which normally covered them.
box tile: a baked clay tile shaped like a rectangular box, open at both

ends, used for ﬂues. [box ﬂue tile]

BP: the abbreviation for “before present,” used especially in radiocarbon
dating. The ﬁxed reference date for before present has been established
as ad 1950.  Thus,  4250 bp would  mean  4250  years  prior  to  1950, 
or  2300 bc.  The  year  1950  was  the  latest  that  the  atmosphere  was

BRICK  BOND

sufﬁciently uncontaminated to act as a standard for radiocarbon dat-
ing.  The  lower  case  “bp”  represents  uncalibrated  radiocarbon  years;
the capitals bp denote a calibrated radiocarbon date, or a date derived
from some other dating method, such as potassium–argon, that does
not need calibration.

bracelet: an ornamental band or chain worn on the wrist or arm.
bracer: a wristguard used in archery, fencing, and other sports.
bracteate: a coin, medal, dish, or ornament made of thin, beaten metal
– usually gold or silver. These items were often disk-shaped, hollow
on the underside and convex on the upper.

brad: a ﬂat nail of the same thickness that tapers in width to a point.
bradawl: a small tool that pierces material, with a ﬂat cutting edge.
Bradshaw ﬁgures: small, red, painted ﬁgures in scenes of the Kimberley
region of Western Australia, named for Joseph Bradshaw who discovered
them.

branding iron: a heated iron used to label, burn, or mark animals, slaves,

criminals, etc.

brass: general name for alloys of copper with zinc or tin, with the propor-
tions about 70–90% copper and 10–30% of the other base metal. It
is possible that due to difﬁculties in introducing the zinc ore calamine
into the melt, brass appeared later in use than bronze (copper and tin)
and other copper alloys. Mosaic gold, pinchbeck, and prince’s metal
are  varieties  of  brass  differing  in  the  proportions  of  the  ingredients.
Corinthian brass is an alloy of gold, silver, and copper.

brazing: a method of joining one piece of metal to another by making

both red hot so that the metal fuses.

break: evidence of accidental damage to a stone tool that resulted in the
loss of an appreciable part of an artifact (usually the distal or proximal
part) and altered its length, width, or shape.

breastplate: a piece of armor covering the chest.
Breton arrowhead: a type of barbed and tanged arrowhead, highly sym-
metrical in form, with slightly concave or convex sides and ﬂared barbs
and the tang the same length as the barbs. It is characteristic of the
Early Bronze Age in northern France and southern Britain.

brick: an important building material of individual blocks of clay or mud,
some with tempering of sand or straw. Bricks, which are not always
rectangular,  may  be  baked  in  a  kiln  to  terra  cotta  or  sun-dried;  the
latter are referred to as mud bricks or adobes. The chief building mater-
ial throughout the Near East has always been mud brick. Bricks can
be used as dating criteria, especially when they bear stamped inscrip-
tions. Decorative glazed bricks ﬁrst appeared in Assyrian times, as at
Ishtar Gate in Babylon.

brick bond: 1. Style or pattern of the layout of bricks. 2. Mortar joint

between bricks.

BRICK-RELIEF

surface or wall.

brick-relief: a technique of sculpture with subjects in bas-relief on a brick

bridle:  headgear  for  a  horse,  usually  consisting  of  a  series  of  buckled
straps  and  a  mouthpiece  by  which  the  horse  is  controlled.  A  bridle
bit is a metal mouthpiece used to control an animal, usually used on
a horse.

briquetage: thick-walled, very coarse ceramic material used for making
evaporation vessels used in saltmaking from the mid 2nd millennium
bc through to medieval times in northern Europe. [VCP, very coarse
pottery]

Britannia metal: a silvery alloy consisting of tin with about 5–15% anti-

mony and usually some copper, lead, or zinc.

broadsword: a broad design of sword used for cutting and slashing.
bronze:  an  alloy  of  copper  and  tin  that  is  harder  than  copper.  Bronze
was  made  before  3000 bc,  though  it  was  not  used  in  tools  and 
weapons for some time. Tin added to copper made casting easier and
the  edges  of  tools  and  weapons  harder.  The  proportions  of  copper
and tin varied widely (67–95% copper in surviving artifacts) and the
addition of zinc, nickel, lead, arsenic, or antimony is also known. The
main  disadvantage  was  the  comparative  scarcity  of  tin.  A  higher 
percentage of tin produces potin or speculum. The Bronze Age of the
Three  Age  System  began  in  Eurasia  when  it  replaced  copper  as  the
main material for tools and weapons. It was then replaced by the more
common and efﬁcient iron, but was still used for decorative purposes.
Modern bronze also contains zinc and lead.

Bronze Age: second age of the Three Age System, beginning about 4000–
3000 bc in the Middle East and about 2000–1500 bc in Europe. It
followed  the  Stone  Age  and  preceded  the  Iron  Age  and  was  deﬁned
by a shift from stone tools and weapons to the use of bronze. During
this  time  civilization  based  on  agriculture  and  urban  life  developed.
Trading to obtain tin for making bronze led to the rapid diffusion of
ideas  and  technological  improvements.  Bronze  artifacts  were  valued
highly and became part of many hoards. In the Americas, true bronze
was used in northern Argentina before ad 1000 and its use spread to
Peru and the Incas. Bronze was never as important in the New World
as in the Old. The Bronze Age is often divided into three periods: Early
Bronze Age (c. 4000–2000 bc), Middle Bronze Age (c. 2000–1600 bc),
and Late Bronze Age (c. 1600–1200 bc) but the chronological limits
and the terminology vary from region to region.

bronze  mirror:  any  of  the  smooth-faced  bronze  disks  of  eastern  Asia 
in the late 2nd millennium bc. These cast-decorated items became import-
ant to the Han dynasty elite in China. In Korea and Japan they were
used for rituals or ceremonies.

brooch:  an  ornamental  pin  or  piece  of  decorative  metalwork  attached
by  a  pin,  that  was  either  a  fastener  or  ornament;  they  are  found 
from c. 1400 bc. Brooches developed from the Roman ﬁbula, which
was similar to a safety pin, and were ﬁrst made at La Tène on Lake
Neuchâtel, Switzerland. Their styles vary, especially in the twisting of
the  spring,  and  may  be  used  to  date  other  ﬁnds.  There  were  long
brooches, rosette or circular brooches, and penannular types.

Brørup  interstadial.:  an  interstadial  of  the  Weichselian  cold  period,
radiocarbon dated to between 63,000 and 61,000 bp, but it may be
earlier.

brownware: a brown-glazed earthenware; pottery that ﬁres to a brown

or reddish color.

painting.

brush:  a  handheld  device  with  bristles  or  hairs  used  for  cleaning  or 

Bubalus  period:  the  earliest  phase  of  rock  art  in  northern  Africa,
between 12,000 and 8000 bc, in which large-scale carvings of animals
appeared. These early engravings – in southern Oran, Algeria, and Libya
–  reﬂect  a  hunting  economy  based  on  the  now-extinct  giant  buffalo
Homoioceras antiquus or Bubalus antiquus (hence the name).

bucchero: a ﬁne gray pottery, with a black or gray shiny surface, which
was produced principally in Greek-speaking or Etruscan areas between
the 8th and 5th centuries bc. Shapes and decoration styles varied greatly
– incised, stamped, and applied techniques were employed. This earthen-
ware pottery was common in pre-Roman Italy between the 7th and
early 5th centuries bc. The shiny surface was produced by polishing
and the color achieved by ﬁring in an atmosphere charged with carbon
monoxide instead of oxygen (“reducing ﬁring”). The light, thin-walled
bucchero sottile, considered the ﬁnest, was made in the 7th and early
6th  centuries  and  the  shapes  were  derived  largely  from  Oriental 
models. In the 6th century the Greek inﬂuence changed the forms to
alabastrums,  amphorae,  kraters,  and  kylikes  with  incised,  modeled,
or applied birds and animals in friezes or geometric schemes. Greek
black pigment was used and human and animal ﬁgures were painted
on the surface of the bucchero in black, red, and white. Techniques
and workmanship declined from about the mid 6th century onward,
when  bucchero  sottile  was  replaced  by  bucchero  pasantë  –  a  heavy,
complex, thick-walled ware that was decorated with elaborate reliefs.
bucket: a cylindrical open container with a handle, used to carry liquids.
bucket  urn:  type  of  large  Middle  Bronze  Age  pot  of  the  Deverel-
Rimbury ceramic tradition of southern Britain c. 1500 bc through to
1200 bc. Bucket urns are plain with some applied cordons, have straight
slightly  sloping  sides,  wider  at  the  top  than  the  bottom.  They  were
used on domestic sites for storage and cremations.

BUCKLE

buckle: a ﬂat rectangular or oval frame with a hinged pin, used for join-

ing the ends of a belt or strap.

Buckley earthenware: c. 1720–1775, North Wales. The body of this earth-
enware  is  quite  coarse  because  of  the  combination  of  two  different
types of clay in the process. The ware is made of layers of pink-ﬁring
and yellow clays. The combination of the two clays served to make
the  poor  clays  more  workable.  The  ware  is  decorated  with  a  black
lead glaze. The exterior fabric color on unglazed portions is purplish-red.
The body exteriors are often heavily ribbed. When broken, the fabric
interior exhibits the characteristic red and yellow layers.

bucranium: in Roman times, an ox skull that was carved in relief and

was part of the decoration of a building.

Central and South America.

Buddhagupta stone: a Sanskrit language inscription of c. 5th century ad
from western Malaysia, due to trade by Buddhists of Southeast Asia.
Related inscriptions have been found in Borneo and Brunei.

bulb of percussion: in ﬂintmaking, a swelling or bulb left on the surface
of a blade or ﬂake directly below the point of impact on the striking
platform – that is, a swelling on a ﬂake or blade at the point where
it has been struck to detach it from a core. On the ﬂake or blade struck
off there is a rounded, slightly convex shape around this point called
the bulb of percussion and on the core there is a corresponding con-
cave bulb. The point and the bulb of percussion are rarely present if
a  ﬂake  has  been  struck  off  naturally,  as  by  heat  or  frost.  Thus  the
presence of a bulb of percussion makes it possible to distinguish human
workmanship from natural breakage. [bulb, bulb of force]

bulbar depression: a depression left from the bulb of percussion when

a blade or ﬂake is struck from a core.

bulbar scar: irregularly shaped scar on the bulb of percussion of a struck
ﬂint ﬂake. It marks the place where a small piece of ﬂint is dislodged
during fracture. The bulbar surface is the surface upon which the bulb
of percussion occurs. This fracture pattern is evident by a bruised strik-
ing platform at the point of impact with shock waves radiating from
it  and,  on  the  resultant  ﬂake,  a  bulb  of  percussion  and  bulbar  scar.
When  these  features  are  present,  it  is  possible  to  distinguish  human
workmanship  from  natural  breakage  caused  by  heat  or  frost.  [bulb
scar, eraillure]

bulbar  surface:  1.  Surface  upon  which  the  bulb  of  percussion  occurs. 

2. Another term for the entire ventral surface of an artifact.

bulla: a hollow lump of clay made as an Etruscan ornamental pendant
or in the Near East as a container for tokens representing goods traded.
A  bulla  was  round  or  oval  and  often  was  decorated  with  ﬁligree  or

BURIN 49

Bunt

granulation decorating on the edges or seal impressions. There was a
removable loop from which the pendant was hung, which may also
have acted as a stopper for the bulla if it contained a liquid, such as
perfume. [bullae (pl.)]

bullet: a projectile discharged from a weapon, usually a ﬁrearm.
bunt:  a  blunted  projectile  point  intended  to  stun  rather  than  to  inﬂect
a  bleeding  wound;  sometimes  difﬁcult  to  distinguished  from  hafted 
scrapers.

Burial  Mound  period:  penultimate  period  of  eastern  North  American 
prehistoric chronology, from 1000 bc to ad 700. Formulated in 1941
by J. A. Ford and Godon Willey, the total chronology, from early to
late, is Paleoindian, Archaic, Burial Mound, and Temple Mound. The
Burial Mound I period (1000–300 bc) covers the transition from Late
Archaic  to  Early  Woodland  ways  of  life  and  is  associated  especially
with the Adena culture. Burial Mound II (300 bc to ad 700) is asso-
ciated especially with Middle and Late Woodland groups, especially
the Hopewell.

burial  urn:  a  vessel  in  which  the  cremated  ashes  of  one  or  more  indi-

viduals are placed.

burin:  a  specialized  engraving  tool  with  a  chipped  ﬂint  or  stone  shaft
that was cut or ground diagonally downward to form a diamond-shaped
point at the tip. The angle of the point affected the width and depth
of the engraved lines. The shaft of the tool was ﬁxed in a ﬂat handle
that could be held close to the working surface. A burin had a wide
rounded end for bracing against the palm of the hand and the point
was  guided  by  the  thumb  and  foreﬁnger.  A  blade  or  ﬂake  could  be
formed into any one of about 20 varieties of the tool. In its most char-
acteristic form, the working tip was a narrow transverse edge formed
by the intersection of two ﬂake scars produced by striking at an angle

to the main axis of the blade. Sometimes one facet was made by sim-
ply snapping the blade, or by truncating it with a steep retouch. Burins
were  used  to  carve  or  engrave  softer  materials  such  as  antler,  bone,
ivory,  metal,  or  wood.  This  tool  was  characteristic  of  the  Upper
Paleolithic  (especially  Magdalenian)  in  the  Old  World  and  of  some
Early Lithic and Mesolithic cultures of the New World. [graver]

burin adze: a term sometimes used by Australian archaeologists for ﬂake
scrapers,  hafted  for  woodworking,  which  are  not  Tula  adzes.  [ﬂake
scraper, non-tula adze]

burin facet: scar formed by the detachment of a burin spall.
burin spall: a small, relatively thick ﬂake removed from a ﬂake or blade
using a snapped termination or previous burination scar as a platform.
burnish:  a  polish  given  to  the  surface  of  an  artifact,  either  to  improve
its appearance and make it more valuable or to compact it (as with
clay) to make it less porous. A pot is polished, often using a spatula
of wood or bone, while it is still in a leathery “green” state, i.e., before
ﬁring. After ﬁring the surface is extremely shiny. Often the whole outer
surface of the pot is thus decorated, but in certain ceramic traditions
there is “pattern burnishing” where the outside and, in the case of open
bowls, the inside are decorated with burnished patterns in which some
areas are left matte. In stroke burnish, the surface is completely polished,
but the marks of the burnisher, a pebble or bone slip, remain distinct.
On bronze it was done to improve the appearance; even mirrors could
be produced in this way. A burnisher is a metal instrument used by
engravers to soften lines or efface them. [burnishing]

burnisher: a tool used to polish the surface of an artifact.
burnt ﬂint: ﬂint that has been burnt. It is not necessarily worked.
butcher marks: marks made on animal bone by stone tools during butcher-
ing. These marks are used to associate humans with animal remains for
a relative date. The marks are classiﬁed according to form and function
as cut marks, chop marks, and scrapes. [chop marks, cut marks, scrapes]
butt beaker: a tall beaker shaped like a butt or barrel, with a small, everted
rim and body usually decorated with cordons, rouletting, latticing, etc.
Dated mid 1st century bc through to 1st century ad in Gallo-Belgicia
and Britain.

butter churn: a vessel used to produce butter from milk through agitation.
butteris: a farrier’s tool for paring a horse’s hoof.
button: small, usually disklike, pieces of bone, metal, stone, or other solid
material that have holes or a shank through which they are sewn on to

BUTTON  AND  LOOP  FASTENER 51

garments. Buttons are used to fasten or close a garment and are some-
times purely decorative. They are known from the Copper Age onwards
in Europe, developing in the Mediterranean area and being spread along
with beakers. The ancient Greeks and Etruscans fastened their tunics
at the shoulders with buttons and loops. The presence of buttons implies
a tailored garment as draped ones were better fastened with a pin or ﬁbula.
button  and  loop  fastener:  a  fastener  made  of  a  metal  circle  connected
to a metal loop ﬁxed to an object and used to fasten to another object
by means of a button or a loop. The usage of these items is unclear,
and could include use for animals or for dress.

C

caccabus: a type of Greek or Roman pot or vessel for cooking any kind
of  food.  It  was  made  of  bronze,  silver,  or  earthenware,  and  had  a 
variety  of  forms.  The  most  common  shape  was  like  an  egg  with  an
opening at the top that was closed with a lid, while the vessel rested
on a trivet (tripus).

cache: a collection of similar items and/or ecofacts that are deliberately
hidden for future use. Caches are often discovered in burials or in caves
and usually consist of ceremonial and ritual objects or emergency food
supplies.

cache blade: quantities of points or blades found together in an under-

ground depository or in a mound.

cadus: a large Greek or Roman earthenware jar, which was a wine jar
but  was  also  used  as  a  measure  for  liquids.  An  ordinary  cadus  was
about  0.9 m  (3  feet)  high  and  broad  enough  in  the  mouth  to  allow
the contents to be baled out.

caelatura:  from  the  Latin  word  meaning  to  emboss  or  engrave;  a 
general term for working in metal by raised work or intaglio, such as
engraving,  carving,  chasing,  riveting,  soldering,  or  smelting.  Similar
work  on  wood,  ivory,  marble,  glass,  or  precious  stones  was  called 
sculptura.

Caeretan  ware:  Archaic  pottery  of  Etruria  that  was  probably  made  at

Cerveteri. It was black-ﬁgured style.

Cahokia point: a side-notched, triangular arrow point with straight sides
to slightly concave basal edges. A few have slightly convex basal edges.
There may be additional side notches on the blade, usually just above
the  primary  side  notches,  or  it  may  be  serrated.  Points  with  two  or
three notches are the most common. The Cahokia point was named
by Edward G. Scully in 1951 for examples found at the Cahokia site

in St. Clair and Madison counties in Illinois. An early Mississippian
point has been found dating in the ad 900–1300 range.

caique: a small wooden sailing vessel, brightly painted, and used around

Greece and in the Aegean for trade.

calabash:  hollow  shell  of  a  gourd  or  pumpkin  or  the  fruit  of  the 
calabash tree, used as a storage or drinking vessel. Such a shell was
used for household utensils, water bottles, kettles, musical instruments,
etc. It is round or oval and hard enough to be used in boiling liquids
over a ﬁre.

calamus:  a  reed  or  cane  used  by  early  writers,  especially  as  an  imple-
ment for scribes working on clay. Calami were usually made from reeds
in Mesopotamia, but also from wood, and the point was sharpened
to form a triangle. The pressure of the calamus on the clay produced
the cuneiform script. Pressing lightly or ﬁrmly made longer or shorter
lines. [calami (pl.)]

calcareous  clay:  any  clay  composed  of,  or  containing,  or  resembling 

calcium carbonate or calcite or chalk.

calcareous  concretion:  a  rounded  mass  of  mineral  matter  occurring  in

sandstone, clay, etc., often in concentric layers around a nucleus.

calcite:  a  white  or  colorless  mineral  consisting  of  calcium  carbonate. 

[calcite varnish]

calcite-gritted ware: pottery with a fabric of crushed calcite (either shell
or mineral grit) as a tempering agent, used especially for storage jars,
cooking pots, and bowls.

calculi: in antiquity, small stones or pebbles used for calculation.
caldron: a large metal pot, used for cooking over an open ﬁre.
calendar  round:  a  ritually  and  historically  important  calendar  used
throughout Mesoamerica in which the solar calendar of 365 days ran
in parallel with a sacred 260-day ritual calendar of named days. The
calendar round is a 52-year cycle, since both calendars begin on the
same day only once every 52 years. Coefﬁcients for days and months
were expressed by bar-and-dot numerals, a system that is ﬁrst known
in Monte Albán I and that became characteristic of the Classic Maya.
The  basic  structure  of  the  Mayan  calendar  is  common  to  all  calen-
dars  of  Mesoamerica.  To  identify  a  date  of  the  calendar  round,  the
Maya  designated  the  day  by  its  numeral  and  name,  and  added  the
name of the current month, indicating the number of its days that had
elapsed by preﬁxing one of the numerals from 0 through 19. A date
written in this way will occur once in every calendar round, at intervals
of 52 years. It is the meshing of the two Maya calendars, the Tzolkin
and the Haab.

universe. The populations of central Mexico believed that they were
living in the ﬁfth epoch of a series of worlds (or suns) marked by cycli-
cal generation and destruction. The central ﬁgure of the stone is this
ﬁfth sun, Tonatuih. Surrounding this are four rectangular cartouches
containing the dates and symbols for the gods Ehecatl, Texcatlipoca,
Tlaloc, and Chilchihuitlicue who represent the four worlds previously
destroyed and the dates of the previous holocausts – 4 Tiger, 4 Wind,
4 Rain, and 4 Water. The central panel contains the date 4 Ollin (move-
ment)  on  which  the  Aztecs  showed  that  they  anticipated  that  their 
current  world  would  be  destroyed  by  an  earthquake.  In  a  series  of
increasingly larger concentric bands, symbols for the 20 days of the
month, precious materials, and certain stars are represented. The out-
ermost  band  depicts  two  massive  serpents  whose  heads  meet  at  the
stone’s  base.  The  Calendar  Stone  is  in  the  Museo  Nacional  de
Antropología (National Museum of Anthropology) in Mexico City.

calendrics: the decipherment and study of calendars.
caliche: an encrustation or deposit of hard, calcareous cement made up
of  nitrates,  sulfates,  halides,  and  sand.  It  appears  on  the  surface  of
materials such as bone, ceramic, or stone after they have been buried
or exposed to moisture for an extended time. These layers of calcium
carbonate  (lime  accumulation)  are  often  present  in  semiarid  or  arid
areas, either on top of or within the soil – as in the desert basins of
southern Arizona. [caliché]

calix: a chalice or cup-shaped vase used as a drinking goblet. It had two

handles and was mounted on a stand.

callaïs: a greenish decorative stone occasionally used for beads from the

Late Neolithic to Early Bronze Age in western Europe.

came: a strip of lead holding small pieces of glass (quarries) in a window.
cameo: an engraving or carving in low relief on a stone.
cameo  glass:  a  Roman  artifact  of  layered,  multicolored  glass  with  the
effect  of  a  cameo  cut  from  onyx.  The  Portland  Vase  in  the  British
Museum is an important example.

Campanian  pottery:  a  type  of  southern  Italian  pottery.  Production
seems to have started before the middle of the 4th century bc, perhaps
under the inﬂuence of Sicilian pottery. There seem to have been three
main  centers  of  production:  two  at  Capua  and  one  at  Cumae.  Late
in its production it seems to draw inspiration from Apulian pottery.
campanulate bowl: a bowl or other kind of vessel (pottery, metal, etc.)

shaped like an inverted bell.

Canaanean  blade:  a  type  of  extremely  regular  and  large  (25–50 mm 
(1–2 inches) wide and up to 25–30 cm (10–12 inches) long) ﬂint blade
produced  by  a  specialized  technique.  The  technology  seems  to  have
ﬁrst  appeared  at  the  beginning  of  the  4th  millennium  bc in  eastern

CARBONIZATION

55

Anatolia and adjoining areas, and was then introduced to the southern
Levant (Canaan) by 3500 bc; these blades were produced until 2000 bc.
Canaanite amphora: common transport vessel of the Late Bronze Age in
the eastern Mediterranean. Canaanite amphoras average 76 cm (30 inches)
in  height  and  have  a  short,  relatively  narrow  ﬂaring  mouth,  a  wide
shoulder with two handles on it, and a tapering proﬁle running down to
a narrow pointed base. They were made in various centers in the east-
ern Mediterranean and were roughly contemporary with stirrup jars.
candelabrum:  1.  A  candlestick,  often  an  ornamental  one,  or  any  kind
of stand by which a light can be supported. 2. A chandelier. [cande-
labra (pl.)]

candle: a cylinder or block of wax or tallow with a central wick which

is lit to produce light as it burns.

candlestick: a support or holder for one or more candles.
canister: a container ﬁlled with musket balls, metal fragments, nails, etc.

Designed to kill or maim the enemy at a close range.

canopic jar: an ancient Egyptian funerary ritual in which four covered
vessels of wood, stone, pottery, or faience were used to hold the organs
removed during mummiﬁcation. The embalmed liver, lungs, stomach,
and intestines were placed in separate canopic jars. The jars or urns
were  then  placed  beside  the  mummy  in  the  tomb,  to  be  reunited  in
spirit,  subject  to  the  appropriate  spells  and  rituals  having  been 
performed.  The  earliest  canopic  jars  came  into  use  during  the  Old
Kingdom  (c.  2575–2130 bc)  and  had  plain  lids.  During  the  Middle
Kingdom  (c.  1938–1600 bc)  the  jars  were  decorated  with  sculpted
human heads, probably depicting the deceased. Then, from the 19th
dynasty until the end of the New Kingdom (1539–1075 bc), the heads
represented the four sons of the god Horus (Duamutef, Qebehsenuf,
Imset, Hapy). In the 20th dynasty (1190–1075 bc) the practice began
of returning the embalmed viscera to the body. The term appears to
refer  to  a  Greek  demigod,  Canopus,  venerated  in  the  form  of  a  jar
with a human head. [canopea, canopic vase, canopic vessel]

cantharus: in Greek antiquity, a large, two-handled drinking cup. This
type of pottery cup was made in Greek-speaking areas and in Etruria
between the 8th and the 1st centuries bc and had a deep bowl, a foot,
and  pair  of  high  vertical  handles.  It  was  often  consecrated  to  per-
soniﬁcations of Bacchus. [kantharos]

Cape Coastal ware: a Stone Age pottery style from the coast of south-
ern Namibia to eastern Cape Province, South Africa, after c. 1600 bp.
It is characterized by point-based pots.

carbonization: the burning or scorching of plants, seeds, grains, or other
organic material in conditions of insufﬁcient oxygen which results in
their preservation. [carbonized, charring (adj.)]

56

CARBOY

carboy:  a  large  bottle,  generally  protected  by  a  basket  or  box,  usually

used for containing corrosive liquids, etc.

carder:  a  ﬂat  board  with  short  spikes  used  to  comb  out  the  staple  of

wool to remove tangles before spinning. Usually used in pairs.

Cardial ware: an impressed ware of the Early Neolithic in the western
Mediterranean (Sardinia, Corsica, Liguria, Provence, Spain). Soft clay
was  impressed  with  the  serrated  edge  of  the  cardium  (cockle)  shell,
from which it received its name. [cardial pottery]

carding comb: a comb used to comb ﬁber before spinning.
carinated: pertaining to a vessel having ridges. [carinate]
carination: a sharp break or angle in the curve of the proﬁle of a con-
tainer or vessel, which resulted in a projecting angle or arris. On ancient
jars or pots, it appeared as a sharply angled shoulder dividing the neck
from  the  body  of  the  vessel.  It  has  been  considered  to  be  a  purely 
stylistic feature derived from metal prototypes, but it may also be that
carinations may have had a practical function – for example, for retain-
ing dregs from a liquid while pouring.

carnelian:  a  reddish-brown  semiprecious  stone  used  for  beads,  seal
stones, and jewelry in antiquity. The Indus Valley civilization, Greeks,
and Romans valued the stone. Engraved carnelians in rings and signets
have offered information about the manners and customs of ancient
Greeks  and  Romans.  It  is  a  translucent  variety  of  the  silica  mineral
chalcedony that owes its color to hematite (iron oxide). Carnelian is
usually found in volcanic rocks, such as the Deccan Traps of western
India, and is also found in Brazil, Australia, Africa, and the Nile Valley.
[cornelian]

carp’s  tongue  sword:  a  type  of  bronze  sword  used  in  the  Late  Bronze
Age  in  western  Europe  –  mainly  in  northwest  France  and  southern
England – in the early 1st millennium bc. It had a broad slashing blade
and a long projecting point for thrusting and a ﬂange hilt.

Carrowkeel  ware:  a  type  of  later  Neolithic  pottery  found  in  Ireland 
during  the  3rd  millennium  bc.  The  fabric  is  generally  thick,  coarse,
and heavily gritted and there are open round-bottomed bowls and hemi-
spherical  cups.  Decoration  is  often  all  over  the  outer  surface  of  the
vessel and the rim, “stab and drag,” or impressed.

cart: a two-wheeled vehicle drawn by a draft animal, used throughout
recorded history for the transportation of goods and people. The cart,
usually  drawn  by  a  single  animal,  was  used  by  the  Greeks  and  the
Assyrians by 1800 bc. However, such vehicles could have been used
as  early  as  3500 bc as  an  extension  of  the  invention  of  the  wheel.
Bronze  Age  ﬁnds  in  Heathery  Burn  included  four  nave-bands  for  a
four-wheeled cart. La Tène two-wheeled chariots are found from the
3rd century bc.

CASTING

57

cartonnage: an Egyptian mummy case made of layers of papyrus or linen
soaked in gesso plaster and shaped around an embalmed body, much
like papier mâché, and then decorated with paint or gilding when dry.
The term also refers to the material thus used and for mummy masks,
anthropoid cofﬁns, and other funerary items made in the same manner.
[cartonage]

cartouche: name given to the oval or oblong ﬁgures in Egyptian hiero-
glyphics that enclosed characters representing royal or divine names
or  titles.  The  term  is  also  used  for  the  amulets  of  similar  design 
worn in ancient Egypt as a protection against the loss of one’s name
(i.e., one’s identity). In architecture, the term refers to the ornamen-
tation  in  scroll  form,  applied  especially  to  elaborate  frames  around
tablets or coats of arms. By extension, the word is applied to any oval
shape or even to a decorative shield, whether scrolled or not. Detailed
examples  of  cartouches  show  that  the  sign  represents  a  length  of 
knotted  rope,  looped  so  that  it  is  never-ending;  it  thus  symbolizes 
cyclical return. The French word cartouche, meaning “gun cartridge,”
was originally given to the royal frame by Napoleon’s soldiers, because
of its cartridge-like shape. [shenu]

cartridge: case containing the charge for a ﬁrearm.
carve: to cut into or shape (a hard material) in order to produce an object

or design. [carving (adj.)]

carved  stone  ball:  any  roughly  spherical  or  slightly  lobate,  artiﬁcially
shaped, carved stones of the later Neolithic and found only in Scotland.
The motifs are similar to those in megalithic art. Undecorated stone
balls are found in other areas of the British Isles from around the 4th
and 3rd millennia bc.

carving:  a  ﬁnishing  or  decorative  technique  that  involves  selective

removal of material with a sharp tool in a pattern.

casing  nail:  a  nail  similar  to  a  ﬁnishing  nail  but  heavier  and  used  for

trim where strength and concealment are required.

cask: a strong wooden barrel.
cast: any molded object.
castellation: a pronounced vertical appendage on the rim of a vessel, much

like that part of a castle wall.

caster: a small swiveled wheel (often one of a set) ﬁxed to a leg (or the

underside) of a piece of furniture.

casting:  1.  Casting  that  consists  of  pouring  molten  metal  into  a  mold,
where  it  solidiﬁes  into  the  shape  of  the  mold.  The  process  was  well
established in the Bronze Age (beginning c. 3000 bc), when it was used
to  form  bronze  pieces.  It  is  particularly  valuable  for  the  economical
production of complex shapes, from mass-produced parts to one-of-
a-kind  items  or  even  large  machinery.  Three  principal  techniques  of

58

CASTING

casting  were  successively  developed  in  prehistoric  Europe:  one-piece
stone molds for ﬂat-faced objects; clay or stone piece molds that could
be dismantled and reused; and one-off clay molds for complex shapes
made in one piece around a wax or lead pattern (cire perdue). Every
metal with a low enough melting point was exploited in early Europe,
except iron and steel, and used for casting artifacts. 2. A process for
forming a ceramic object by pouring a clay slip into a hollow, porous
(usually plaster) mold and leaving it there long enough for a layer of
clay to settle and thicken on the mold wall. The remaining slip is poured
off, and the object is removed from the mold when it has dried. [slip
casting, solid casting]

casting  ﬂash:  a  thin  irregular  ridge  of  metal  on  the  outer  face  of  a 
casting, from seepage of the molten metal into the joint between the
separate  components  of  the  mold  used  in  its  manufacture.  During 
the  ﬁnal  cleaning  and  ﬁnishing  of  a  cast  object,  the  ﬂash  is  usually
knocked off and ﬁled smooth. [casting jet, casting seam]

casting jet: a plug of metal which is knocked out after an artifact is cast
and which ﬁts exactly into the opening (aperture or gate) of a mold.
When  casting  metal  into  a  bivalve  or  composite  mold,  the  aperture
through  which  the  metal  is  poured  into  the  mold  becomes  ﬁlled  up
with  molten  metal,  and  this  plug  of  metal  cools  and  hardens  with 
the object. When the ﬁnished artifact is removed from the mold, the
casting  jet  is  still  attached;  in  most  cases  it  is  knocked  off  and  the 
scar polished down, with the metal plug being melted down for reuse.
In some cases, however, it may be left on, particularly on neck rings
and bracelets. Examples are sometimes found in founder’s hoards. [cast-
ing ﬂash, casting seam]

casting seam: the place where a small amount of molten metal will run
into the joint between the surfaces of the parts of the casting mold.
In a bivalve or composite mold, this seepage results in a visible seam
when the object is removed from the mold. It is usually ﬁlled and pol-
ished  off;  unﬁnished  objects  are  often  found  with  a  visible  seam  or
ridge. [casting ﬂash, casting jet]

casting-on technique: a method used in a secondary stage of making metal
objects for adding handles, legs, and hilts to complex artifacts. A clay
mold is placed around part of an existing object and molten metal is
then poured in and fuses onto the original object.

Castor box: a shallow vessel in color-coated ware with a lid and usually

rouletted, c. Roman times in Britain.

Castor ware: a distinctive pottery named after a Roman settlement site
on  the  north  bank  of  the  Nene  in  Northhamptonshire.  Castor  ware
is a slate-colored pottery that commonly had hunting scenes of dogs,

CAVETTO  RIM

59

boars, etc. on the outer surface, which were applied by squeezing paste
from a bag or applying by brush. The E barbotine hunt cups were a
highlight of the native Romano-British potter’s craft. [Nene Valley ware]
casual  tool:  object  used  as  a  tool  once  or  twice  for  a  speciﬁc  purpose

and discarded with no purposeful modiﬁcation.

catafalque: a decorated wooden platform upon which a sarcophagus was
temporarily placed before burial. These ornate funereal structures were
often mounted on a stage to support a cofﬁn for a lying-in-state.

catalog: an inventory of archaeological data in which an artifact is labeled
with a reference number and described in detail. The catalog number
is the unique number assigned to each individual item – or group of
items – in an archaeological collection. [catalogue]

catalog number: the unique number assigned to each individual item (or
group of items) in an archaeological collection. [catalogue number]
catch-plate: curved metal plate that holds the pin of a brooch in place.
categorization:  an  aspect  of  the  classiﬁcation  process  that  consists  of 

creating groupings within a previously unclassiﬁed set of objects.

catlinite:  red  clay  from  the  upper  Missouri  region,  used  by  the  Native

Americans for their pipes.

cauldron:  a  large  metal  vessel  for  cooking,  usually  with  a  round  base,
heavy ﬂange rim, and handles for suspending it over a ﬁre. Examples
date from the European Late Bronze Age, with especially important
ones from Urartu (an ancient country of southwest Asia). In the Iron
Age, they were sometimes made of silver. Cauldrons were usually made
of  sheet  bronze  riveted  together  and  having  two  to  four  handles.
Cauldrons were a sign of great wealth or power.

cave art: any paintings, engravings, or designs on cave walls; man’s oldest
surviving art, especially those by Paleolithic and Pleistocene people that
are found in southwest France, northeast Spain, and elsewhere in Europe.
Other sites have been discovered in Portugal, Italy, Greece, and the Ural
mountains; the only known Russian site is Kapovo Cave. The subject
matter of cave art is predominantly animals, especially mammoth, horse,
ox,  deer,  and  bison;  human  ﬁgures  are  relatively  uncommon.  There
are also numerous signs and symbols. The artist used a range of reds,
blacks, yellows, and browns derived from ochers and other naturally
occurring mineral pigments (iron oxide and manganese dioxide). The
purpose and meaning of cave art are still obscure. In France, the caves
are mainly in the limestone of the Perigord and Pyrennean regions and
the  most  famous  are  Altamira,  Lascaux,  Niaux,  and  Pech  Merle.
Occupational evidence is rarely found with the art.

cavetto rim: a rim, especially on black-burnished cooking pots, that curves

outwards from the vessel to form a concave proﬁle.

60

CAVETTO  ZONE

Celt

cavetto zone: a concave area of the face below a rim or on the shoulder

of a ceramic vessel between carinations.

Celadon ware: a type of Chinese pottery with a pale green glaze – either
porcelain  or  stoneware.  It  was  the  earliest  tinted  Chinese  pottery, 
dating from the Sung dynasty of ad 960–1279. The main kilns were
in  Yao-chou  in  Shensi  province,  Lin-ju  in  Honan  province,  and  Li-
shui and Lung-ch’uan in Chekiang province. [celadon]

celt:  a  New  Stone  Age  tool,  usually  a  polished,  ungrooved  ax  or  adze
head  or  blade  that  would  be  attached  to  a  wooden  shaft.  The  tool,
often shaped like a chisel and made of stone or bronze, was probably
used  for  felling  trees  or  shaping  wood.  Great  numbers  of  celts  have
been discovered in the British Isles and Denmark and were traded widely.
Bronze Age tools of similar general design are also called celts.

Celtic art: an art style of the European Iron Age, c. 500 bc, developed
presumably by Celtic peoples. It originated on the middle Rhine River,
extending  to  the  upper  Danube  and  the  Marne.  Its  ﬁnest  specimens
are from the British Isles in the 1st century bc and ad. It appears most
commonly in bronzework or other metals, weapons and horse gear,
eating and drinking vessels, personal ornaments, and monumental stone
carvings.  It  seems  likely  that  the  craftsmen  worked  under  the  direct
patronage of the chieftains. Techniques employed were decoration in
relief, engraving, and inlay. Stylistically, Celtic art combines elements
taken from the Classical world, from the Scythians to the east and from
the local earlier Hallstatt Iron Age. The art developed into several styles
in continental Europe (Early, Waldalgesheim, Plastic, and Sword styles)
but  came  to  an  end  with  the  Roman  occupation.  In  Ireland,  the  art
style returned after the Roman withdrawal. [La Tène art]

Cenozoic: the most recent geological era in the Earth’s history, in which
mammals  came  to  dominate  animal  life.  The  Cenozoic  runs  from 
66.4 million years ago to the present and began when Asia acquired
its  present  appearance  and  mammals  came  to  dominate  animal  life.
The most important tectonic event in the Cenozoic history of Asia was
its collision with India some 50 million years ago. This collision took
place some 2100 km (1250 miles) farther south of the present loca-
tion  of  the  line  of  collision  along  the  Indus–Brahmaputra  suture
behind the main range of the Himalayas. The Cenozoic includes the
Tertiary and Quaternary periods.

centripetal: moving or tending to move toward a center.
ceramic:  an  artifact  made  of  hard  brittle  material  produced  from 
nonmetallic minerals by ﬁring at high temperatures; a solid made of 
compounds of metallic elements and inorganic nonmetallic elements:
earthenwares,  porcelains,  stonewares,  terra  cottas,  and  other  mater-
ials made of ﬁred clay.

CHACMOOL

61

ceramic analysis: any of various techniques used to study artifacts made
from  ﬁred  clay  to  obtain  archaeological  data.  Color  is  objectively
described by reference to the Munsell soil color charts. Examination
under  the  microscope  may  reveal  the  technique  of  manufacture  and
allow the identiﬁcation of mineral grains in the tempering, which will
identify the area of manufacture. Reﬁring experiments often show how
the original baking was done.

ceramic  artifact:  any  artifact  made  of  ﬁred  clay,  belonging  to  pottery,

ﬁgurine, or other ceramic industries.

ceramic ecology: a framework for studying ceramics from the perspec-
tive of the manufacturing steps and use, analogous to the Chaine opér-
atoire in lithic analysis.

ceramic petrology: the study of the composition, texture, and structure
of the minerals in the clay from which pottery is manufactured. The
purpose of ceramic petrology is to locate the source of the clay from
which the pot was made. Ceramic petrology involves either heavy min-
eral analysis or petrologic microscopy, both of which require samples
to be removed from the pot. Neutron activation analysis is also used.
Results from these studies have far-reaching consequences for the study
of early economic systems. Not only has it been shown that pottery
and its contents were transported over long distances in antiquity, but
also  that  the  specialized  manufacture  and  marketing  of  pottery
started as far back as the ﬁrst agriculture in Europe.

ceramics:  the  art  or  process  of  making  useful  and  ornamental  articles
from clay by shaping and then hardening them by ﬁring at high tem-
peratures. Ceramics are generally known as pottery, but the term also
refers to the manufacture of any product from a nonmetallic mineral
by ﬁring at high temperatures. The exceptional porcelain and stone-
wares of China are very well known, from as early as the Yang-Shao
Neolithic culture, c. 4500 bc. [pottery]

ceramique oncteuse: a type of medieval pottery of western Brittany, made
from the 10th to 18th centuries. It is typically very soft and uses talc
as the tempering material. This unusual pottery was a distinctive prod-
uct of the Breton culture.

ceremonial object: any artifact associated with a ritual or ceremony or
that functions only in a symbolic sense, as opposed to a tool or other
practical device.

cestrum: a type of ivory graver used in encaustic painting on ivory, with

one pointed end. [viriculum]

chacmool: a Mesoamerican life-sized sculpted stone ﬁgure representing
a reclining human with the head turned to one side, knees drawn up,
and hands holding a shallow receptacle ﬂat on the stomach. This was
a widespread art form in the Post-Classic period, especially at the Toltec

62

CHACMOOL

sites of Tula and Chichen Itza and at Aztec and Tarascan sites. It was
located at the entranceway to temples and was probably a repository
for offerings.

chaﬁng  dish:  a  cooking  pot  with  an  outer  pan  of  hot  water,  used  for

keeping food warm.

chain: a series of connecting metal links.
chain mail: a type of protective body armor in the form of interlinked
metal  rings,  worn  by  European  knights  and  other  military  men
throughout most of the medieval period. An early form of mail, made
by  sewing  iron  rings  to  fabric  or  leather,  was  worn  in  late  Roman
times and may have originated in Asia, where it was worn for many
centuries. [mail]

Chaine  opératoire:  a  perspective  for  studying  lithic  technology  that
emphasizes the sequence of decisions and behaviors from raw mate-
rial selection and acquisition, through manufacture, use, recycling, and
discard.

chalcedony: a ﬁne-grained hard stone, a variety of the silica mineral quartz.
A  form  of  chert,  it  is  found  in  a  variety  of  milky  or  grayish  colors
with distinctive parallel bands of contrasting color. In antiquity, chal-
cedony was the stone most used by the gem engraver for beads, seals,
and sometimes as a substitute for ﬂint. Agate, carnelian, jasper, and onyx
are some of the varieties still cut and polished as ornamental stones.
Chalcidian  ware:  black-ﬁgured  pottery  found  in  Etruria  and  the
Chalcidian  colony  of  Rhegium  (modern  Reggio)  in  Italy.  The  style
included lettering of the inscriptions as part of the decoration.

Chalcolithic:  literally,  the  “Copper  Stone  Age,”  a  period  between  the
Neolithic (Stone Age) and the Bronze Age, from 3000 to 2500 bc, in
which  both  stone  and  copper  tools  were  used.  It  was  a  transitional
phase  between  Stone  Age  technology  and  the  Bronze  Age  with  its
increase  in  trade  and  cultural  exchanges.  The  term  is  much  less
widely  used  than  other  divisions  and  subdivisions  of  the  Three  Age
System, partly because of the difﬁculty in distinguishing copper from
bronze without chemical analysis, partly because many areas did not
have a Chalcolithic period at all.

chalice: a stemmed cup used for holding the wine during communion.
chamber pot: a bowl kept in a bedroom and used as a toilet.
chamberstick: a single candle holder with a curved handle coming from

the base.

champlevé:  an  enameling  technique  or  an  object  made  by  the  process;
a form of inlay in which the pattern is cut out of the metal to be orna-
mented.  The  pattern  was  then  ﬁlled  with  enamel  frit  and  fused  in 
an  oven,  or  ﬁlled  with  polished  stones  or  shells.  Champlevé  can  be
distinguished  from  the  similar  technique  of  cloisonné  by  a  greater 

CHARIOT

63

irregularity  in  the  width  of  the  metal  lines.  It  developed  as  a  Celtic
art  in  western  Europe  in  the  Roman  period  and  was  copied  by  the
Anglo-Saxons. In the Rhine River valley and in Belgium’s Meuse River
valley,  champlevé  production  ﬂourished,  especially  during  the  late 
11th  and  12th  centuries.  It  was  often  used  in  the  decoration  of  the
escutcheons on hanging bowls. [champ-levé, champleve enameling]

Chancay: in central Peru, a distinctive type of pottery made by the Chancay
people between ad 1000 and 1500 (from the Late Intermediate Period).
It  is  black-on-white  with  a  parallel  or  checkered  design,  sometimes
with biomorphic ﬁgures or painted in soft colors. The most common
forms  were  tall,  two-handled,  egg-shaped  collared  jars;  bowls  and
beakers with slightly bowed sides; and large ﬁgurines. The pottery is
associated with large efﬁgy ﬁgurines, dolls, and lacelike textiles. Chancay
weaving was considered excellent.

channel ﬂake: the long, thin blade of stone removed longitudinally from
the base of a ﬂuted Paleoindian projectile point by percussion or pres-
sure from the center line of either face. The smooth depression it leaves
behind is known as a ﬂute or channel. [channel ﬂaking (n.)]

channeled: the decoration of an artifact with grooves or broad incisions.
channel-rimmed jar: a type of cooking pot with an out-turned rim with
one or more distinct grooves on it, mid to late 1st century in Roman
times in Britain.

chape: the metal mounting, trim, or case of the upper end of a sword

scabbard, protecting the tip.

characteristic  points:  points  on  the  contours  of  a  vessel  silhouette  or 
vertical section marking angles (corner points) or curvature (inﬂection
points), used in one system of classifying vessel shapes.

characterization: the qualitative and quantitative description of the composi-
tion and structure of a material so as to evaluate its properties and uses.
charcoal: a porous black form of carbon obtained when wood is heated

in the absence of air.

charger: a large ﬂat dish or platter.
chariot: a light vehicle of war, usually carrying two people – a warrior
and  a  driver.  Examples  have  been  found  from  the  Uruk  period  in
Mesopotamia,  and  the  chariot  was  on  the  standard  of  Ur.  It  ﬁrst
appeared  in  the  Near  East  in  the  17th  century  bc,  associated  with 
the immigrant peoples who became the Hyksos, Kassites, and Hurri.
Its  arrival  in  Egypt  can  be  fairly  reliably  dated  to  the  Second  Inter-
mediate Period (1650–1550 bc). The Aryans carried it to India, and
in China it formed the core of the Shang army. The Mycenaeans intro-
duced it to Europe, where it spread widely and rapidly. It revolutionized
warfare  by  allowing  warriors  to  be  transferred  rapidly  from  one 
part of a battleﬁeld to another. It was mainly for aristocrats, which

CHARIOT

explains its popularity as a funeral offering. Burials of complete char-
iots with horses and charioteers have been excavated in Shang China
(1200 bc), in Cyprus from the 7th century bc, and among the La Tène
Celts. The earliest Celt chariot burials are in the Rhineland and east-
ern  France  with  dates  around  500 bc,  and  later  burials  are  found 
in  east  Yorkshire  and  Europe  as  far  east  as  Hungary,  Bulgaria,  and
southern  Russia.  The  chariot  was  replaced  by  the  mounted  warrior
or knight when horses of sufﬁcient strength had been bred in the late
and post-Roman periods.

charm: a small ornament worn on a necklace or bracelet.
chasing: a technique for the decoration of metalwork by engraving on
the outside of the raised surface. The metal is worked from the front
by hammering with tools that raise, depress, or push aside the metal
without  removing  any  from  the  surface.  Chasing  is  the  opposite  of
embossing,  or  repoussé,  in  which  the  metal  is  worked  from  the 
back to give a higher relief. Strictly, chasing refers to line decoration
applied  to  the  face  of  repoussé  work  with  a  tracer,  but  the  term  is
frequently used more generally to describe any hammered or punched
decoration on metal.

Chavín culture: Early Horizon communities living in the northern high-
lands  and  the  northern  and  central  sections  of  the  coast  of  Peru  in
the period 900–250 bc with recognizable architectural styles (temples),
iconography, and ceramic forms. The focus of the Chavín culture is
the site of Chavín de Huantar, Peru.

Cheddar  point:  type  of  later  Upper  Paleolithic  ﬂint  tool  of  the  British
Isles,  named  for  Cheddar  Gorge,  Somerset,  England.  The  point  was
made on a relatively narrow ﬂint blade, and both ends were worked
to make an elongated trapezoidal form with the long side of the blade
left unworked and the shorter side blunted.

Cheddar  ware:  a  regional  type  of  late  Saxon  pottery  (Saxo-Norman 
pottery)  dating  to  the  period  ad 850–1150  manufactured  in  central
Somerset, England.

cheekpiece: 1. Part of a horse bridle, a crescent section of brow tine from
a deer’s antler, perforated with a central hole or slot for the soft mouth-
piece of rope or leather, with perforations above and below for a bifurc-
ate rein. Found in the Early Bronze Age of the Carpathian Basin dating
to the mid 2nd millennium bc. 2. A plate or rod of bone, bronze, leather,

or another metal that is attached to the lower rim of a helmet to pro-
tect the wearer’s cheeks.

cheese press: a type of small, ﬂat-bottomed ceramic dish with holes and
concentric ridges on the bottom, sometimes with a ﬂat matching lid.
chekan: a special kind of striking weapon for hand-to-hand combat. It
was most widespread in southern Siberia and in Central Asia in the
Scythian period. The chekan is a kind of battle ax with a thin sharp
point, made of bronze. It was ﬁxed onto a long wooden shaft which
had a bronze butt at its lower end and was worn at the waist on a
special  belt.  Chekans  are  quite  often  decorated  with  zoomorphic
ﬁgures in the Scythian–Siberian animal style.

Chelford: an interstadial of the Devensian cold stage (the last glaciation),
c.  61,000 bp  according  to  radiocarbon  dating  –  though  it  could  be
older.

Chellean:  an  outdated  classiﬁcation  term  used  for  the  ﬁrst  stage  of 
biface  manufacture  believed  to  precede  the  Acheulian,  and  named 
after the type site of Chelles in the Somme Valley, France. It is now
generally  accepted  that  Chellean  implements  should  be  classiﬁed  as
early Acheulian. The term Chello-Acheulian, once applied to African
Earlier  Stone  Age  biface  assemblages,  has  also  been  replaced  by  the
term Acheulian.

Chelsea  sword:  early  type  of  bronze  sword  found  in  southern  Britain,

with a leaf-shaped blade, ﬂat section, and hilt tang.

chert: a coarse type of siliceous (silica) rock, a form of quartz, used for
the manufacture of stone tools where ﬂint was not available. It is of
poorer quality than ﬂint, formed from ancient ocean sediments, and
often has a semi-glassy ﬁnish. It is pinkish, white, brown, gray, or blue-
gray in color. Flint, chert, and other siliceous rocks like obsidian are
very hard, and produce a razor-sharp edge when properly ﬂaked into
tools. This crystalline form of the mineral silica is found as nodules
in  limestones.  Varieties  of  chert  are  jasper,  chalcedony,  agate,  ﬂint,
and novaculite. Chert and ﬂint provided the main source of tools and
weapons for Stone Age man.

chest  punch:  a  purported  device  for  removing  ﬂutes  from  Clovis  and

Folsom tools. [crutch]

Chester-type  ware:  a  type  of  late  Saxon  pottery  dating  to  c.  ad 850–

1150, made in northwest England.

chevron: a symbol of a series of connected W-shapes used to decorate

pottery and metalwork.

chevron ﬂaking: a V-shaped ﬂaking pattern which extended beyond the

distal tip along much or all of one or both faces of a blade.

Chicoid: one of the two ceramic series (the other is the Meillacoid) that
seem  to  have  developed  out  of  the  Ostinoid  series.  They  originated

66

CHICOID

near the type site of Boca Chica, Dominican Republic, and then inﬂu-
enced much of the eastern Antilles. The Chicoid materials represent the
ball game, Zemis, a variety of wood and stone carvings, and a strong
Barrancoid inﬂuence is evident in the ceramics (modeled ornamentation
and  incision).  The  series  ﬁrst  appears  in  c.  ad 1000  and  continued
until European contact. [Boca Chica]

Chien ware: a dark brown or blackish glazed Chinese stoneware made
for domestic use, mainly during the Sung dynasty (960–1279) and into
the  early  14th  century.  Within  its  limited  palette,  Chien  ware  has  a
range  of  variations.  By  careful  control  of  the  kiln  temperatures,
streaking  and  iridescent  patches  were  formed  on  the  glaze  to  make
the  “hare’s  fur”  and  “oil  spot”  glazes,  which  were  the  most  prized.
Large deposits of kiln wastes have been found at Chien-yang and Chien-
an in Fukien province. Tea bowls are by far the most common, though
not the only, form of Chien ware that survive. Used by Ch’an (Zen)
Buddhist monks, the highly esteemed tea bowls were carried back to
Japan by Japanese monks who had visited China to study Buddhism.
Until the late 16th century, Chien ware was the type of tea bowl pre-
ferred  for  the  highly  ritualized  Japanese  tea  ceremony.  [Chien  Yao,
Jian Yao, Temmoku ware, Tenmoku ware]

china:  a  vitriﬁed/glassy  and  nonporous  ceramic  ﬁred  to  a  temperature

of 1100–1200°C.

china clay: a ﬁne, usually white, clay formed by the weathering of alu-

minous minerals (as feldspar); used in ceramics.

Chindadn point: a small teardrop-shaped bifacial point found in central
Alaska and dating to c. 12,000–10,000 bp; they are diagnostic of the
Nenana complex.

Chiot  pottery:  archaic  pottery  of  the  Greek  island  of  Chios,  though  it
may also have been made at Naucratis. The pots and chalices had a
cream slip and glazed interior. Decoration on the exterior was of scenes
with ﬁgures; inside were ﬂoral patterns.

chip-carving: a technique of decoration with the use of an ax, hatchet,
mallet,  and/or  chisel,  which  probably  originated  in  the  Roman  and
Celtic world. The technique was adapted by Germanic woodcarvers
to  make  animal  ornaments  and  by  metalsmiths  of  the  Migration
period. This excised decoration was done by cutting from the surface
triangular and rectilinear small chips. The end result was a pattern of
combined  V-shaped  incisions,  with  a  glittering  faceted  appearance. 
It is found in woodwork and pottery, when it has to be done before
the  clay  is  ﬁred.  False  relief  is  a  special  version  of  this  technique.
Examples are the Tassilo Chalice (Kremsmünster Abbey, Austria) and
the Lindau Gospels book cover (Pierpont Morgan Library, New York
City). [chip carving]

chippable: of a stone, capable of being worked to produce a tool or other
such  artifact.  Chipped-stone  artifacts  are  the  class  of  lithic  artifacts
produced by fracturing ﬂakes from a core. [chipped-stone]

chipped-stone tool: any tool produced by ﬂaking or chipping of pieces

from a stone core to produce an implement. [chipped artifact]

chipping ﬂoor: an area used for the manufacture or maintenance of ﬂint
or  stone  tools,  recognized  by  work  waste,  broken  or  partly  ﬁnished
implements, and discarded raw material.

chisel: a long-bladed hand tool with a beveled cutting edge,
struck  with  a  hammer  or  mallet  to  cut  or  shape  wood,
stone, or metal.

chisel-ended arrowhead: a type of arrow tip of ﬂint or stone,
with a sharp, straight cutting edge at right angles to the
axis of the arrow shaft, rather than a point.

chocolate  ﬂint:  a  variety  of  high-quality  ﬂint  from  the  Holy  Cross
Mountains  in  central  Poland,  used  by  prehistoric  peoples  from  the
Mesolithic  to  the  Early  Bronze  Age.  It  occurs  in  round  ﬂat  nodules
and in slabs no more than 10 mm (4 inches) thick. Chocolate ﬂint is
very homogeneous and has excellent ﬂaking qualities. It was usually
mined  from  shallow  pits  about  2.4 m  (8  feet)  deep.  Four  chocolate
ﬂint  mines  have  been  investigated  at  Tomaszow,  Wierzbica-Zele,
Polany, and Polany-Kolonie.

choker: a neck band or necklace worn tightly around the throat.
chokkomon:  in  Japanese  archaeology,  a  design  of  shattered  spirals

engraved on artifacts of the Kofun period.

chopper: any large, simple stone or pebble tool with a single, transverse
cutting edge. It was used for hacking, breaking, or chopping and was
especially  characteristic  of  Middle  Pleistocene,  pre-Acheulian  indus-
tries  of  the  Old  World,  such  as  Choukoutien,  in  the  Clactonian  in
England, and at the earliest levels of Oldowan industries. This crude
tool was made by striking a limited number of ﬂakes from the edge
of a cobble or ﬁst-size rock to produce a coarse cutting edge. It per-
sisted until the Neolithic. [chopping tool, slitter]

chous: a Greek or Roman measure of liquids, containing an eighth of a
Roman amphora, or about 4 L (7 pints). It was also equal to 12 Greek
cotyle. [congius]

chroma:  saturation,  purity,  or  strength  of  color;  in  the  Munsell  color
chart, chroma is the horizontal dimension, denoting the presence or
absence of gray.

chronological type: a type deﬁned by form that is a time-marker.

CHRONOLOGY

the collection of dates or successive datings establishing the position
in time of a series of phenomena such as the phases of a civilization or
the events of the history of a state. A chronology is relative/ﬂoating
when only the order of a succession of facts is known, but not their
dates, and absolute when the dates are known. For periods or areas
for which no textual evidence is available, relative chronologies have
to be established and these are mostly based on pottery sequences and
typology. Relative chronology is also based on the application of the
principles of stratigraphy and cross-dating. The discovery of inscribed
monuments and calendars associated with dated astronomical obser-
vations contributed to the development of an Egyptian chronology and
it has served as a framework – through cross-dating – for all other Near
East chronologies. Inscribed Egyptian objects found in Near Eastern
contexts have allowed the latter to be dated. Absolute chronology is
based on scientiﬁc methods such as radiocarbon dating, thermolumin-
escence dating, and archaeomagnetism. Dates are often calibrated with
dendrochronological dates. For dates after 1500 bc, an absolute chrono-
logy is not likely to change by more than 10 years.

chronometric date: a date indicating that a measured value of time (years,

centuries) has elapsed since a past event occurred.

chronostratigraphic  sequence:  a  time  scale  in  which  the  sequence  of 
geologic  time  units  and  their  corresponding  time–rock  divisions
(chronostratigraphic  units)  are  deﬁned  by  standard  and  internation-
ally  agreed  reference  points  within  boundary  stratotypes.  [chrono-
stratigraphic scale]

chryselephantine statue: a type of ﬁgurine sculpture made of ivory and
gold. The ﬂesh was of ivory and the drapery of gold. These were pro-
duced in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Crete, and in Greece from
the 6th century bc. They were often colossal cult ﬁgures placed in the
interiors of major temples, such as that of Minerva by Pheidias, which
stood  in  the  Acropolis  at  Athens  and  was  12 m  (40  feet)  high,  and
that  of  Zeus,  13.7 m  (45  feet)  high,  also  by  Pheidias,  in  the  temple
of Olympia.

chultun: a bottle-shaped underground cistern found at some sites in the
Maya lowlands. They were probably used for water or food storage.
Chün  ware:  a  Chinese  stoneware  of  the  Northern  Sung  period
(ad 960–1126) with a pale blue opalescent or translucent green glaze,
made at the kilns near Lin-ju-hsien and at Kung-hsien in Honan province
in  China.  Another  well-known  class  has  a  red  or  ﬂambé  glaze  and
consists of ﬂowerpots, bulb bowls, elegant shallow dishes, waterpots,
and small boxes. [Jun]

cinerarium: a place for depositing the ashes of the dead after cremation;

a niche in a tomb for holding an urn of ashes or a sarcophagus.

CLACTONIAN

69

cinerary urn: a sepulchral vessel or urn used to preserve the ashes of the

dead after cremation. [cinerary vessel]

cire perdue: a metalworking technique used to cast ﬁgurines and statues.
A model of the object to be cast is made in wax – solid if the object
is to be of solid metal, or made around a clay core if it is to be hol-
low. The wax model is covered with clay, and the whole is heated to
allow the wax to melt and run off; this leaves a space into which molten
metal is poured. After it has cooled the outside clay is knocked off,
the inner core may be removed, and remaining is a metal version of
the original wax model. The technique is common on every continent
except Australia and dates from the 3rd millennium bc, having gone
through few changes since then. Since the “mold” cannot be used again,
each  version  of  an  object  made  using  this  technique  is  unique,  and
the process is more time consuming than making a complex mold and
reusing  it.  However,  more  detail  can  be  accomplished  with  the  cire
perdue process. [lost wax process]

Cistercian ware: a lead-glazed English earthenware of the 15th to 16th
centuries. The earthenware is dark red with a black or brown metallic-
appearing  glaze  and  was  called  Cistercian  because  they  were  ﬁrst 
excavated  at  the  Cistercian  abbeys  of  Yorkshire.  The  pottery  forms
were mainly drinking vessels, tall mugs, trumpet-shaped tygs (with two,
four,  or  eight  handles),  and  tankards.  The  majority  of  the  ware  is 
undecorated, but some examples are distinguished by horizontal rib-
bing or by white slip ornamentation consisting of roundels or rosettes.
Potteries producing these wares were at Abergavenny (Monmouthshire),
Tickford (Derbyshire), and Wrotham (Kent).

cistern: an artiﬁcial reservoir or receptacle, such as an underground tank,
for holding water or another liquid. It was especially used for catch-
ing and storing rainwater.

Clactonian:  an  early  ﬂake-tool  culture  of  Europe,  dating  from  the 
early Mindel-Riss (Great interglacial) of the Pleistocene epoch, which
occurred  from  1,600,000  to  10,000  years  ago.  It  was  named  after 
discoveries at Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, England. A kind of concave scraper,
perhaps  used  to  smooth  and  shape  wooden  spears,  is  typical  of  the
Clactonian industry. Apart from the tip of a wooden spear, the arti-
facts  consist  of  trimmed  ﬂint  ﬂakes  and  chipped  pebbles,  some 
of which can be classiﬁed as chopper tools. Hand axes were absent.
The  Clactonian  seems,  therefore,  to  have  coexisted  with  the  early
Acheulian. Some believe that the two industries are quite distinct, while
others maintain that both assemblages might have been made by the
same people, and that the Clactonian could in theory be an Acheulian
industry from which hand axes were absent because such tools were
not needed for the jobs carried out at a particular site. Clactonian and

70

CLACTONIAN

related  industries  are  distributed  throughout  the  north  European
plain,  and  Clactonian  tools  are  similar  in  appearance  to  those  pro-
duced in the Soan industry of Pakistan and in several sites in eastern
and  southern  Africa.  The  Tayacian  industry  of  France  and  Israel  is
believed to be a smaller edition of the Clactonian.

clasp: a device with interlocking parts for fastening; a buckle or brooch.
class: a general group of artifacts, like “hand axes,” which can be bro-

ken down into speciﬁc types, like “ovates,” etc.

classic example: a subjective term used to refer to a speciﬁc point speci-
men that represents the truest form of a particular point type or blade.
classical, Classical: a general term referring to the period of time when
a  culture  or  civilization  reaches  its  highest  point  of  complexity  and
achievement. In a broader sense, the term often describes the whole
period of Greek and Roman antiquity with the following breakdown:
Early  Classical  500–450 bc,  High  Classical  450–400 bc,  and  Late
Classical 400–323 bc. Speciﬁcally, the term describes, in New World
chronology,  the  period  between  the  Formative  (Pre-Classic)  and  the
Post-Classic, which was characterized by the emergence of city states.
During  the  Classic  stage,  civilized  life  in  pre-Columbian  America
reached its fullest ﬂowering, with large temple centers, advanced art
styles, writing, etc. It was originally coined for the Maya civilization,
initially deﬁned by the earliest and most recent long count dates found
on Maya stelae, ad 300–900. A division between Early and Late Classic
was arbitrarily set at ad 600, since in some areas, e.g., Teotihuacán,
great  civilizations  had  already  collapsed;  some  scholars  regard  this 
date as marking the end of the Classic period. By extension, the word
came  to  be  used  for  other  Mexican  cultures  with  a  similar  level  of
excellence  (Teotihuacán,  Monte  Albán,  El  Tajín).  In  these  areas  the
cultural  climax  was  roughly  contemporary  with  that  of  the  Maya, 
and  the  term  Classic  took  on  a  chronological  meaning  as  well.  The
full Maya artistic, architectural, and calendric-hieroglyphic traditions
took place during the Early Classic. Tikal, Uaxactún, and Copán all
attained their glory then. In the Late Classic, between ad 600 and 900,
ceremonial centers in the Maya lowlands grew in number, as did the
making of the inscribed, dated stelae and monuments. The breakdown
of  the  Classic  period  civilizations  began  with  the  destruction  of  the
city of Teotihuacán in about ad 700. Some date the Classic period to
ad 300–900. [classic, Classic]

classiﬁcation: the ordering of archaeological data that share certain attri-
butes or characteristics into groups and classes; the divisions arrived
at by such a process. Classiﬁcation is the ﬁrst step in the analysis of
archaeological data – when particles or objects are sorted or categor-
ized by established criteria, such as size, function, material, or color.

CLAY  TABLET

71

clastic rock: a rock composed of broken pieces of older rocks.
claw beaker: elaborate glass beakers dating from c. ad 500 onward in
early Saxon graves and Frankish burials. Also called Rüsselbecher, the
beakers have two superimposed rows of hollow, trunklike protrusions
curving  down  to  rejoin  the  wall  of  the  vessel  above  a  small  button
foot. In form they are similar to free-standing conical beakers, apart
from  the  embellishment  of  a  series  of  unusual  clawlike  protrusions.
In many cases the glass is tinted brown, blue, or yellow. The beakers
were probably made in Cologne or Trier, Germany. [elephant’s trunk
beaker, Rüsselbecher]

clay: soil particles of less than 0.005 mm in diameter, or rock composed
mainly  of  clay  particles.  There  are  ceramic  clays,  clay  shales,  mud-
stones, glacial clays, deep-sea clays, and soils – which are plastic when
wet  and  hard  when  dry.  No  other  natural  material  has  so  wide 
an importance or such extended uses as does clay. The use of clay in 
pottery-making antedates recorded human history, and pottery remains
provide  a  record  of  past  civilizations.  As  building  materials,  bricks
(baked and as adobe) have been used in construction since earliest times.
clay  pipe:  a  clay  tube  with  a  small  bowl  at  the  end  used  for  smoking

tobacco.

clay tablet: the main writing material used by the scribes of early civil-
izations.  Signs  were  impressed  or  inscribed  on  the  soft  clay,  which 
was  then  dried  in  the  sun.  The  ancient  Sumerians,  Babylonians,
Assyrians,  and  Hittites  wrote  on  tablets  made  from  water-cleaned 
clay.  A  common  form  was  a  thin  quadrilateral  tile  about  12.5 cm 
(5 inches) long which, while still wet, was inscribed by a stylus with
cuneiform  characters.  By  writing  on  the  surface  in  small  characters,
a scribe could copy a substantial text on to a single tablet. For longer
texts, several tablets were used and then linked by numbers or catch-
words. Book production on clay tablets probably continued for 2000
years in Mesopotamia and Asia Minor. Either dried in the sun or baked
in  a  kiln,  clay  tablets  were  almost  indestructible.  The  latter  process
was used for texts of special value, legal codes, royal annals, and epics
to  ensure  greater  preservation.  Buried  for  thousands  of  years  in  the
mounds of forgotten cities, they have been removed intact or almost
so in modern archaeological excavations. The number of clay tablets
recovered is nearly half a million, but there are constantly new ﬁnds.

CLAY  TABLET

The largest surviving category consists of private commercial documents
and government archives. When the Aramaic language and alphabet
arose in the 6th century bc, the clay tablet book declined because clay
was less suited than papyrus to the Aramaic characters.

claymore: a two-edged broadsword.
cleavage: property possessed by many minerals of breaking in a certain
preferred  direction  along  smooth  plane  surfaces;  property  possessed
by  certain  rocks  of  breaking  with  relative  ease  along  parallel  planes
or nearly parallel surfaces. Rock cleavage is designated as slaty, phyl-
litic, schistose, and gneissic.

cleavage surface: a surface formed by a separation of the rock along a
natural cleavage plane or crack, especially in quartz crystals, slate, and
petrifried wood. [cleavage plane]

cleaver: a heavy, large core or ﬂake tool of the Paleolithic period, typic-
ally  having  a  wide,  straight  cutting  edge  at  one  end,  like  a  modern
axhead. Technologically it is related to the hand ax, and is often found
as  a  component  of  Acheulian  (especially  Upper  Acheulian)  hand-ax
industries.  The  sharp  transverse  cutting  edge  was  almost  always
notched by use but never sharpened. Along with bifacial tools, it was
one of the main instruments of Homo erectus. It is found mainly in
Africa, where much of the ﬂake surface is left unretouched. The axlike
knife was used from the Middle Pleistocene era to cut through animal
bone and meat.

clench nail: a nail adapted so that the end of the nail can be turned over

and driven back into the substance through which it has passed.

clinker: ash and partially fused residues from a coal-ﬁred furnace or ﬁre.
clipped wing: a barbed shoulder that has been fractured off or clipped.
cloisonné: a technique of decorative enameling in which different colors
of  a  pattern  are  separated  by  thin  strips  of  metal.  It  consists  of  sol-
dering,  to  a  metal  surface,  thin  metal  strips  bent  to  the  outline  of  a
design  and  ﬁlling  the  resulting  spaces,  called  “cloisons”  (French  for
“partitions” or “cells”) with vitreous enamel paste. The object is ﬁred,
ground smooth, and polished. Sometimes metal wire is used in place
of  gold,  brass,  silver,  or  copper  strips.  It  was  used  in  Anglo-Saxon
England and by Germanic metalsmiths to decorate polychrome jew-
elry and metalwork. The technique is somewhat similar to champlevé,
but  it  allows  more  intricacy  of  design.  Among  the  earliest  examples
of cloisonné are six Mycenaean rings of the 13th century bc. The great
Western period of cloisonné enameling was from the 10th to 12th cen-
turies, especially in the Byzantine empire. In China, cloisonné was widely
made  during  the  Ming  (1368–1644)  and  Ch’ing  (1644–1911/12)
dynasties. In Japan, it was especially popular during the Tokugawa,
or Edo (1603–1868), and Meiji (1868–1912) periods.

closed ﬁnds: groups of artifacts that are in original depositional context
with  each  other;  the  artifacts  recovered  from  a  ceremonial  offering,
for instance.

closed  vessel:  a  vessel  with  an  oriﬁce  that  is  narrow  relative  to  the 

vessel’s height. [restricted vessel]

closestool: a stool or chair containing a chamber pot.
closure: any item used to seal a glass container, including both glass and

nonglass items such as metal and ceramic bottle caps.

Clouded  ware:  developed  shortly  after  the  introduction  of  creamware,
in  England  c.  1750–1775.  Thomas  Astbury  and  Thomas  Whieldon
mixed ground ﬂints into the clay which gave a white-saltglaze when
high ﬁred and a cream-colored ware when ﬁred at lower temperatures.
After preliminary ﬁring, the ware could be dipped in a clear glaze. In
about 1750, tea wares were colored under the glaze, which produced
the  ware  known  as  Clouded  ware.  The  colors  used  for  this  were 
purple, brown, yellow, green, and gray.

Clovis  point:  a  distinctive,  ﬂuted,  lanceolate  (leaf-shaped)  stone  pro-
jectile point characteristic of the early Paleoindian period, c. 10,000–
9000 bc, and often found in association with mammoth bones. It is
named  for  Clovis,  New  Mexico,  where  it  was  ﬁrst  found.  The 
concave-based projectile point has a longitudinal groove on each face
running  from  the  base  to  a  point  not  more  than  halfway  along  the
tool. The base of a Clovis point is concave and the edge of the base
is  usually  blunted  through  grinding,  probably  to  ensure  that  the
thongs,  attaching  the  point  to  the  projectile,  were  not  cut.  It  is
assumed to have been a spear because of its size; the length of points
varies from 7 to 12 cm (2–4 inches), and their widest width is 3–4 cm
(1–1.5  inches).  Clovis  points  and  the  artifacts  associated  with  them
(grouped together as the Llano complex) are among the earliest tools
known from the New World and have been found over most of North
America,  with  a  few  outliers  as  far  south  as  Mexico  and  Panama. 
It  is  the  earliest  projectile  point  of  the  Big  Game  Hunting  tradition 
of  North  America.  From  these  points  came  the  later,  more  sophist-
icated  points,  such  as  the  Folsom.  [Clovis  projectile  point,  Clovis 
spear point]

cluster: a group of stylistically and chronologically similar artifacts for
which adequate excavation data do not exist to allow for the classi-
ﬁcation as a phase.

coarseware: a classiﬁcation of sandy, rough pottery including Castor ware,

New Forest ware, and Rustic ware. [coarse pottery, coarse ware]

coating: adding a slip, wash, or glaze to the surface of a ceramic item.
cob: wet clay mixed with straw used in creating walls, ovens, and other

structures.

COBBLE

cobble: a rounded stone worn smooth by the action of water and used

as a core for a stone tool; thus “cobble tool.”

cobble  reduction  technique:  a  stone-working  technique  in  which  the 
craftsman  works  a  chunk  of  stone  to  produce  from  it  a  number  of
potentially useful pieces.

Cochise  point:  a  type  of  projectile  point  from  4000 bc to  perhaps 
500 bc, indicating an increased interest in hunting, of the US south-
west  (Arizona).  Currently  the  use  of  the  Cochise  culture  concept  is
fairly uncommon.

codex: any handwritten manuscript of the Scriptures, either Christian or
in Mesoamerica before the Spanish conquest (from the Latin caudex,
meaning  “trunk  of  a  tree”).  In  Mesoamerica,  these  documents  were
written and painted in hieroglyphic or pictographic characters on bark
paper or animal skin and they contain information about pre-Columbian
and post-conquest life. The surviving codices, of which there are four,
were folded concertina-fashion, like a map. The information concerned
astronomy, religious ceremonies, calendrics, genealogy, or simple ac-
counting. The best surviving example is the Dresden Codex. A number
were commissioned by the Spanish and some are copies of earlier works,
including the Mayan Book of Chilam Balam, the Popol Vuh, and the
Aztec tribute lists of the Mendoza Codex. Those written post-conquest
sometimes resemble a book in format. The early Christian gospel books
were produced in monasteries in the post-Roman era, including Codex
Sinaiticus, Alexandrinus, and Vaticanus. [codices (pl.)]

codpiece: an appendage worn on the front of breeches.
cofﬁn: any box or chest, usually rectangular or anthropoid in shape, in
which a corpse or mummy is enclosed for burial. Clay, stone, metal,
and  wood  are  among  the  materials  used.  Primitive  wooden  cofﬁns,
formed  from  a  tree  trunk  split  down  and  hollowed  out,  are  still  in
use among some aboriginal peoples. The term “sarcophagus” is used
only  for  the  stone  outer  container  that  encases  one  or  more  cofﬁns.
From the Latin cophinus, meaning “basket.” [sarcophagus]

cogwheel: a wheel with a series of teeth on its out-
side which interlock with similar teeth on another
cogwheel to receive or give motion.

coil  and  paddle:  a  method  of  pottery-making  in-
volving the use of rolled clay coils to build vessel
walls,  followed  by  the  welding  of  the  walls  with 
a  decorated  wooden  or  ceramic  paddle.  Parallel
breaks between the coils and impressed designs on

Cogwheel

pottery fragments are evidence of this technique.

coil fracture: a smooth-edged circumferential breakage characteristic of
coiled vessels in which the coils were poorly bonded, resulting in planes
of weakness.

COIN  BALANCE

coil pot: any ceramic vessel formed gradually by adding spirals of thin,
sausage-like coils of clay, which are smoothed out afterwards to form
the walls of the pot.

coil-building:  a  method  of  pottery-making  in  which  a  rope  of  clay  is 
coiled around a ﬂat base and continued up to form the walls of a pot.
The  layers  of  clay  are  pressed  together,  and  the  inside  and  outside
smoothed off to remove the lines between the coils. Frequently this is
not done completely, and the coils may still be visible. Pottery often
breaks along the coil lines. [coil-built pottery, coiling]

coiling: 1. A method of basketry based on a spirally coiled foundation,
especially that made with a vertical stitch or weft. A basket is said to
be coiled when a long bundle of ﬁbrous material is laid up, spiral fash-
ion.  Each  coil  is  sewn  by  a  slender  splint  to  the  coil  below  it.  The 
basketmaker pierces the ﬁber bundle with an awl and passes the splint
through  the  hole  thus  made.  [coil  basket,  coiled  basketry;  coiled
(adj.)] 2. In ceramics, a construction technique where the vessel is formed
from  the  base  up  with  long  coils  or  wedges  of  clay  that  are  shaped
and joined together. Ropelike cylinders of the body are gradually added
along  the  circumference  of  the  vessel,  starting  at  a  disklike  base,  to
build up the vessel’s shape. [coil; coiled (adj.)]

coin: a piece of metal or, rarely, of some other material (such as leather
or porcelain) certiﬁed by a mark or marks upon it as being of a speciﬁc
value.  Coinage  is  considered  to  be  any  standardized  series  of  metal
tokens, their speciﬁc weights representing speciﬁc values, and usually
stamped with designs and inscriptions. Coins or coinlike objects were
ﬁrst  issued  by  the  Lydians  of  Anatolia  in  the  late  7th  century  bc,
made  of  the  gold–silver  alloy  electrum.  Their  use  was  then  adopted
in  the  Far  East,  then  around  the  Mediterranean,  and  has  since 
spread  throughout  the  world.  Early  coins  were  used  for  specialized,
prestigious purposes and not for everyday exchange. The early Greek 
coins were also made of electrum, silver, or gold; the ﬁrst Roman coins
were  produced  in  the  early  3rd  century  bc and  were  also  made  of 
precious metals. Later in that century the ﬁrst bronze coin was intro-
duced. These material remains are self-dating, though they do not always
date the materials they are found with as they may have been traded,
handed  down  through  generations,  or  displaced  in  the  stratigraphy 
of a site.

coin  balance:  small  lightweight  scales  used  by  merchants  for  checking
the weight of coins offered in exchange. This was important because
the value of a coin was in part determined by its metal content. Because
precious metals such as gold and silver were used in making coins in
order  to  retain  their  value,  a  good  trade  could  be  made  by  clipping
off small amounts of metal from many coins to produce forged coins
or other items.

76

COIN  HOARD

coin hoard: a group of coins deliberately deposited together.
coinage:  a  standardized  series  of  metal  tokens,  their  speciﬁc  weights 
representing particular values, and usually stamped with designs and
inscriptions. They were used in many parts of the ancient world for
everyday exchange. Greek coinage ﬁrst appears in the Archaic deposit
of  the  Artemision  at  Ephesus.  Roman  coinage  was  struck  at  Rome
and various points throughout the empire.

cold hammering: a technique for making metal artifacts in which the metal
is shaped by percussion without heating. Most metals, such as copper,
bronze,  gold,  and  silver,  are  soft  enough  to  be  worked  while  cold.
Operations such as hammering and beating could be carried out with-
out any heating to make the metal softer. These softer metals, how-
ever,  cannot  be  cold  worked  indeﬁnitely  because  the  metal  becomes
brittle  and  eventually  fractures.  This  can  be  counteracted  by  gentle
heating  called  annealing.  Annealing  allows  crystals  within  the  metal
to recrystallize and distribute the stress that has built up. Cold working
can then go on until the metal becomes brittle again. Metallographic
examination  –  the  study  of  crystal  structure  –  can  give  information
about the cold working and annealing processes in the last stages of
the making of an artifact. Pure gold is one of the few metals that can
be cold worked indeﬁnitely without annealing. [cold working]

collar: a ridge formed about the neck of a vessel; a raised, angular band,

line, or strip.

collared urn: a type of urn used in the British Early Bronze Age, also called
an overhanging rim urn. It has a developed rim which may be straight,
convex, or slightly concave in proﬁle. Decoration is normally on the rim
or the upper half of the vessel. Collared urns often contained crema-
tion burials, though some have been found in domestic contexts.

collaring:  part  of  wheel-throwing  a  vessel  that  involves  using  both
hands to apply inward pressure on the rotating body to narrow it and
form a neck or closure.

collateral  ﬂaking:  when  ﬂakes  on  a  chipped  stone  artifact  extend  to 
the middle from both edges forming a medial ridge. The ﬂakes are at 
right angles to the longitudinal axis, and are regular and uniform in
size.

colorant: a chemical element that contributes color to a mixture. Unglazed,
low-ﬁred pottery is colored chieﬂy by carbon, iron, and manganese,
whereas a broader range of colors occurs in glazes.

color-coated ware:  a  way  of  referring  to  many  kinds  of  pottery  in  the
Greek and Roman periods that were given an extra surface coating,
usually slightly glossy and most often red. Research suggests that the
coating was made from ﬁne clay particles suspended in water with a
peptizing agent added.

COMPLEX

77

colossus: a gigantic statue or image of the human form, usually of a king
but also of private individuals and gods. They are typically set up out-
side the gates or pylons of temples. The term was originally applied
by Herodotus to those of Egypt. The most famous is the bronze statue
of Apollo at Rhodes, one of the seven wonders of the world, reputed
to have stood at the entrance to the harbor and claimed by Pliny to
have been 27 m (90 feet) tall. [colossi, colossuses (pl.)]

comb: a toothed object of wood, bone, horn, metal, etc. with a number
of  uses  –  for  hair  dressing,  carding  wool,  currying  horses,  compact-
ing the weft in weaving, for decorating pottery, or as an ornament to
keep the hair in place. As used for combing the hair, but not wear-
ing, combs were found in Pompeian and Egyptian tombs and in early
British, Roman, and Saxon barrows.

combed ornament: any pottery decorated by drawing a toothed instru-
ment across the surface of the soft clay or colored slip. The pottery
was  often  decorated  by  the  application  of  two  or  more  different-
colored  slips  that  were  either  brushed  or  combed  to  produce  the 
effect of marbled paper, with a broad band of parallel incisions, often
wavy. [combed ware]

combing: a ﬁnishing technique in ceramics manufacture whereby a tool
with multiple teeth or prongs is dragged along the surface of the fabric
to leave multiple, nearly parallel, incisions, either straight or wavy.

commodity: an object created for exchange and trade.
common brad: a nail used for attaching parquet ﬂooring to the subﬂoor

and molding to walls and furniture.

common nail: general purpose, heavy-duty type of nail used in construction

and rough work, with a large head that will not pull through.

communion token: metal token that served as a certiﬁcate of ﬁtness for
admission to the communion. They were used mainly in the Church
of Scotland, where their place has been largely taken by printed cards
on which the names of the communicants are written.

comparative collection: collections of identiﬁed bones or other artifacts

used for comparison with archaeologically recovered remains.

compartmented seal: the typical, usually metal, seal of the Bronze Age
in western Central Asia and northern Afghanistan. Most often round,
the seal motifs were geometric or of objects in nature.

complex: a group of artifacts and traits that regularly appear together
in two or more sites within a restricted area over a period of time and
which are presumed to represent an archaeological culture. A complex
could be a characteristic tool or type of pottery or it could be a pat-
tern  of  buildings  that  occur  together.  A  complex  is  a  chronological
subdivision of different artifact types and implies a culture, whereas
an assemblage is merely a collection of contemporaneous specimens.

78

COMPLEX  SHAPE

complex  shape:  a  vessel  shape  that  in  silhouette  is  marked  by  two  or
more characteristic points of inﬂection, or changes in curvature, or by
both corner and inﬂection points.

component: 1. A culturally homogeneous stratigraphic layer within a site
that belongs to one culture and is interpreted as the remains of a single
people during a relatively brief period of time. 2. Archaeological mater-
ials found in a single level of a single site – the manifestation of a given
phase at a single site. At a particular site, there may be present several
components, recognized by critical changes in the artifact assemblages.
A number of similar and contemporary components make up a phase.
composite bow: an archer’s bow made of more than one material – such
as wood and ﬁberglass – to combine the properties of strength, durabil-
ity, and power. In early times, a bow of wood was reinforced on one
side by layers of animal sinew and on the other side by animal horn.
composite mold: a kind of mold for making metal objects that can have
three or more pieces. It may be a simple bivalve mold with the addi-
tion of a third part – a plug which will form a socket in the artifact
when it is removed.

composite shape: a vessel shape that in silhouette is marked by charac-

teristic points of angles or corners and lacks inﬂection points.

composite tool: a tool formed of two or more joined parts, e.g., a com-

posite toggling harpoon head.

compound: a substance comprising atoms of two or more elements, hav-

ing relatively ﬁxed composition and properties.

compound tool: any tool made of two or more different materials, such
as a bone harpoon with stone points and barbs set in it, or a wooden
arrow with a shaped stone point. Also, an artifact made of multiple
parts. [composite tool]

compression: the stress of a crushing force applied to a material.
compression rings: the faint lines on the dorsal side of a ﬂake, indicat-

ing the direction of force. [ripple marks]

concave:  curving  inward;  having  an  outline  or  surface  that  curves

inwards like the interior of a sphere.

conchoidal ﬂake: a type of spall resulting from the fracture of ﬁne-grained
or  glassy  rocks.  It  is  characterized  by  a  bulb  of  percussion,  striking
platform remnant, and extremely sharp edges. There is a predictable
fracture  pattern  that  allows  the  manufacture  of  predetermined  tools
from these materials.

conchoidal fracture: a characteristic shell-like fracture pattern that occurs
in siliceous rocks, such as obsidian, chert, and ﬂint. The fracture has
smooth, shell-like convexities and concavities. [conchoidal]

cone: small, elongated pyramid made of controlled mixtures of ceramic
materials in a numbered sequence that softens and bends when heated

CONTEXT

79

under speciﬁc conditions. When cones are placed in a kiln during ﬁring,
their bending provides an index of heat treatment and proper ﬁring.
[pyrometric cone]

cone beaker: a type of Anglo-Saxon glass drinking vessel of around the

5th to 7th centuries ad, in the shape of an elongated cone.

cone  mosaic:  a  type  of  wall  decoration  used  in  the  Uruk  (VI–IV)  and
Jemdet Nasr periods of southern Mesopotamia. Stone or baked clay
cones  were  stuck  into  the  surface  of  building  facades  to  produce  a
colored mosaic geometric pattern. Examples have been found in the
Eanna section of Warka.

cone of force: a cone-shaped area on a stone core and its associated ﬂake,

which results when force is applied to separate the ﬂake.

conﬁguration: the arrangement of decorative motifs on a vessel so as to

ﬁll a spatial division and form the design.

cong: a tubular, jade object, circular on the inside and enclosed in a rect-
angular  body,  made  in  various  sizes  and  used  for  ritual  purposes 
in  ancient  China.  Cong  were  described  in  ancient  Chinese  texts  as 
symbols of rank and were used as ritual objects primarily in the Shang
(18th to 12th century bc) and Zhou/Chou (1111–255 bc) dynasties.
They  have  been  found  in  graves,  arranged  with  bidisks  around  the
corpses of the elite. The cong is thought to have symbolized Earth or
possibly to have been an astronomical instrument. [ts’ung]

conical: having the shape of a cone.
conjoining:  the  rejoining  or  ﬁtting  together  of  struck  stone  ﬂakes  to 
recreate  the  original  core,  or  the  reﬁtting  of  waste  ﬂakes  to  ﬁnished
or  unﬁnished  tools.  The  technique  is  used  to  study  the  dispersal  of
implements and debitage at ancient working sites, and to gain an under-
standing of the knapping process. [reﬁtting]

conoidal theory of ﬂint fracture: the theory that ideally a cone will be
punched out of a piece of ﬂint when it is struck with sufﬁcient force.
constituent  analysis:  any  technique  used  to  reveal  the  composition  of 
artifacts  and  other  archaeological  materials  by  examining  their  con-
stituent parts. This type of analysis is useful in determining raw mater-
ial sources for the reconstruction of ancient exchange systems.

contact mold: a mold used to produce a full-sized, or part of a full-sized,

glass item.

contact  period:  the  period  in  the  history  and  culture  of  the  Americas
when the ﬁrst impact of the Europeans was made. This is often dated
to ad 1513 with the arrival of Ponce de Leon in Florida.

contained remains: all portable objects found in the strata of a site, whether

organic or inorganic, natural or manmade.

context:  the  time  and  space  setting  of  an  artifact,  feature,  or  culture.
The context of a ﬁnd is its position in a site, its relationship through

80

CONTEXT

association  with  other  artifacts,  and  its  chronological  position  as
revealed  through  stratigraphy.  Certain  features  or  artifacts  may  be 
normally  associated  with  particular  contexts,  for  example  a  pottery
type may be found in the context of certain burials. If such an artifact
is found out of context, it may suggest the previous presence of a bur-
ial,  the  robbery  of  a  burial,  or  a  place  of  manufacture  of  the  pots 
that accompanied burials. An artifact’s context usually consists of its
immediate  matrix  (the  material  surrounding  it,  e.g.,  gravel,  clay,  or
sand),  its  provenience  (horizontal  and  vertical  position  within  the
matrix), and its association with other artifacts (occurrence together
with other archeological remains, usually in the same matrix). The assess-
ment of context includes study of what has happened to the ﬁnd since
it was buried in the ground.

contracting: in lithics, a term that refers to the width of a stem or point

that is diminishing in outline.

convex: curving or bulging outward; having an outline or surface that

curves outwards like the exterior of a sphere.

cooking pot: jars or bowls used for cooking, which is known from soot

encrustation.

cooking stone: any stone heated for a long time or several times by being
placed in water or stew in order to convey heat to the water or stew.
Also, cooking balls may have been laid on top of red-hot coals and
then meat laid on top of the balls to cook.

coolamon: an Australian aboriginal carrying dish made of wood or bark.
copper:  a  ductile,  malleable  metallic  element  used  in  many  functional
and decorative artifacts. It was one of the ﬁrst metals to be exploited
by people because, like gold, it can be found in the native form, pure
and requiring no smelting. It is most frequently obtained from a variety
of  ores:  carbonate  (malachite),  oxides,  and  sulﬁdes.  Shaping  can  be
done  by  simple  hammering,  which  also  serves  to  harden  the  metal.
“Pure” copper may contain up to 1% impurities and the concentra-
tions of these impurities may indicate the source of the ore. Arsenical
copper alloys (2–3% arsenic) have some advantages over pure copper
in the ease of casting and in the hardness of a hammered edge. In the
New World, cire perdue casting of copper is ﬁrst recorded in the Paracas
culture  of  Peru  and  by  the  European  conquest;  the  technique  was 
practiced from the southwest US to Argentina. Copper occurs fairly widely
in the Old World, and was ﬁrst used in western Asia before 8000 bc
as a substitute for stone, though it did not come into common use until
after 4000 bc. Metallurgy dawned in Egypt as copper was cast to shape
in molds (c. 4000 bc), was reduced to metal from ores with ﬁre and
charcoal, and was intentionally alloyed with tin as bronze (c. 3500 bc).
The  earliest  surviving  examples  from  Egypt  are  small  artifacts  such 

CORACLE

81

as beads and borers of the Badarian period, c. 5500–4000 bc. Great
copper hoards occur in the Ganges-Yamuna alluvial plain and just south
of the lower Ganges, and elsewhere in India and Pakistan.

Copper Age: an intermediate period between the Neolithic and Bronze
Ages, characterized by the use of copper tools. According to the prin-
ciples of the Three Age System, it should strictly mean the period when
copper was the main material for man’s basic tools and weapons. It
is difﬁcult to apply in this sense as copper at its ﬁrst appearance was
very scarce, and experimentation with alloying seems to have begun
early on. The alternative names of Chalcolithic and Eneolithic imply
the joint use of copper and stone. In many sequences, notably in Europe
and  Asia,  there  is  a  period  between  the  Neolithic  and  Bronze  Age,
separated from each by breaks in the cultural development, within which
copper was coming into use and Copper Age is the best term to use.
In Asia, the age saw the origins of civilization, and in Europe the great
folk movements of the Beaker and Corded ware cultures, and perhaps
the  introduction  of  the  Indo-European  languages.  The  period  lasted
for almost 1000 years in southeast Europe, from 3500 bc.

copper hoard: a hoard of copper artifacts, many of which occur in the
Ganges-Yamuna doab (alluvial plain) and in the area south of the lower
Ganges, the former occasionally associated with ocher-colored pottery.
The hoards, dated broadly to the 2nd millennium bc, include ﬂat axes,
anthropomorphous  axes,  barbed  harpoons,  and  sword  blades.  They
have been cited as evidence of the Vedia arrival by some. Other copper
hoards with different artifact typologies also occur elsewhere in India
and Pakistan.

coprolite: fossilized or desiccated human or animal feces. The study of
these remains can provide information about human or animal activ-
ity in that particular locale, such as diet and disease; the study of these
remains is called coprology. Coprolites only survive in exceptional cir-
cumstances – arid, frozen, and occasionally waterlogged deposits. They
can be reconstituted by the addition of chemicals like trisodium phos-
phate, and can then be analyzed for their plant and animal remains.
This gives additional insight into what was being eaten at a site, since
the evidence from pollen analysis, or ﬂotation, only suggests what was
being grown.

Coptic period: chronological phase in Egypt lasting from the end of the
Roman period, c. ad 395, until the Islamic conquest, c. ad 641. It is
also described as the “Christian” period and is roughly equivalent to
the Byzantine period elsewhere in the Near East.

coracle: primitive, light, small bowl-shaped boat with a wattle frame of
grasses, reeds, or saplings covered with hides. They were ﬁrst known
in the Iron Age and are still used in Wales and along coastal Ireland,

82

CORACLE

usually with a canvas and tar covering. The term also refers to an Old
English  boat  of  wickerwork  covered  with  hides.  Native  Americans 
used the similar bullboat, covered with buffalo hides, on the Missouri
River,  and  the  corita,  often  sealed  with  bitumen,  on  the  Colorado.
[curragh]

cord ornament: pottery decoration produced by impressing a twisted cord
into the surface of soft clay. Sometimes short individual motifs were
produced by wrapping a cord around a stick (Peterborough ware), or
part  or  the  whole  of  a  vessel  was  wrapped  closely  in  cord  (Corded
ware and some varieties of beaker).

cordage: cords or ropes, especially the ropes in the rigging of a ship.
cordate: of or pertaining to a reﬁned heart-shaped biface with a ﬂat proﬁle,

characteristic of the Mousterian in western Europe.

Corded ware: a Late Neolithic pottery ware decorated with twisted cord
ornament  found  over  much  of  north  and  central  Europe  in  the  2nd
half of the 3rd millennium bc. The commonest shapes are the beaker
and the globular amphora. The ware is always associated with early
agriculture, the stone battle ax, and usually with single burial under
a small barrow or kurgan. The ware may derive from Denmark, cen-
tral Germany (Saxo-Thuringia), eastern Poland, or the Ukraine. The
culture received its name from the characteristic pottery. Some groups
also  had  metal  artifacts.  There  is  some  evidence  that  Corded  ware 
people  had  domesticated  horses  and  wheeled  vehicles,  and  they  are
sometimes  interpreted  as  nomadic  groups  –  possibly  Indo-European
speaking – who spread across northern Europe from the east. Closely
related are the Globular amphora and Funnel beaker cultures.

Cordilleran: the ice mass that covered the coastal mountains along the
Paciﬁc Ocean coast of North America from northern Washington state
into southern Alaska. At its maximum extent, about 20,000 years ago,
it  connected  with  the  Laurentide  ice  sheet  to  the  east  and  with  the
Paciﬁc Ocean to the west, and reached a thickness of some 3 km (1 mile).
The Cordilleran geosyncline was a linear trough in the Earth’s crust in
which rocks of Late Precambrian to Mesozoic age (roughly 600 million
to  66  million  years  ago)  were  deposited  along  the  western  coast  of
North America, from southern Alaska through western Canada and
the United States, probably to western Mexico. The eastern boundary
of the geosyncline extended from southeastern Alaska along the eastern
edge  of  the  northern  Cordillera  and  northern  Rocky  Mountains  of
Canada  and  Montana,  along  the  eastern  edge  of  the  Great  Basin  of
Utah and Nevada, and into southeastern California and Mexico. The Old
Cordilleran culture appeared in the Paciﬁc Northwest about 9000 or
10,000 bc and persisted until about 5000 bc in some areas. Subsistence
was  based  on  hunting,  ﬁshing,  and  gathering.  Simple  willowleaf-
shaped, bipointed projectile points are characteristic artifacts.

CORE  TOOL

83

cordon: in ceramics, a strip of clay added around the outside surface of
a pot before ﬁring for decoration or handling. The cordon(s) may be
decorated  in  some  way,  for  example  with  ﬁngertip  or  stick  impres-
sions. On wheel-turned pots, cordons may be created by pushing the
clay  out  in  a  narrow  ring  from  inside,  achieving  a  similar  effect.  In
metalworking, a cordon is formed in much the same way as for a wheel-
turned pot, that is, by the repoussé technique.

cordoned urn: a type of Middle Bronze Age pottery in the northern parts
of the British Isles during the 2nd millennium bc, generally tall straight-
sided vessels with a ﬂat base, slightly ﬂaring body and a simple rim.
The  outer  face  is  decorated  with  applied  cordons  ornamented  with
incised decoration.

cord-ornamented pottery: ceramic vessels whose outer faces are decor-
ated  with  motifs  created  by  pressing  twisted  cord  into  the  soft  clay
surface before the pot is ﬁred. Some have short individual motifs, or
long  pieces  of  cord  are  coiled  around  the  pot  and  then  pressed  into
the surface. [cord-marked pottery]

core: 1. A piece of stone used as a blank from
which ﬂakes or blades were removed by pre-
historic  toolmakers.  Usually  it  was  the  by-
product of toolmaking, but it may also have
been  shaped  and  modiﬁed  to  serve  as  an
implement  in  its  own  right.  An  object,  such
as a hand ax, chopper, or scraper made in this
way is a core tool. Cores were most often pro-
duced  when  hit  by  a  pebble,  antler,  or  bone
hammer. [blank, nucleus] 2. A black or gray zone in the interior cross-
section of a vessel wall, usually associated with incomplete removal of
carbonaceous matter from the clay during relatively low-temperature
ﬁring; not to be confused with black coring at high temperatures, which
results from trapped gases and may lead to bloating. [coring (n.)]

Parent

core borer: a hollow tubelike instrument used to collect samples of soils,
pollens, and other materials from below the surface. The cylinder of
soil, etc., that is collected is called the core. The core is undisturbed
and the sediment contacts, soil boundaries, and structures are intact
and can be described accurately.

core rejuvenation ﬂake: a roughly round and slightly wedge-shaped ﬂake
of ﬂint with the remains of ﬂake beds around the outside edge. These
ﬂakes are created to extend the life of a core that has become uneven
or difﬁcult to work. [core tablet]

core tool: a stone tool, such as a hand ax, chopper, or scraper, formed
by  chipping  away  ﬂakes  from  a  core.  These  tools,  often  large  and 
relatively heavy, were characteristic of Paleolithic culture. They were
made by using a pebble, antler, or bone hammer. [core-tool]

CORE-FORMED  GLASS

core-formed  glass:  a  type  of  glass  made  by  twisting  melted  glass 
around  a  core,  often  with  different  colors.  This  technique  was  used
especially  in  the  Classical  and  Hellenistic  periods  of  the  eastern
Mediterranean.

Corinthian  pottery:  a  widely  distributed  pottery  made  at  Corinth  and
found throughout the Mediterranean, from the late 7th century bc until
the mid 6th century bc. This important stage of vase painting included
“naturalistic” designs of animals, maenads, and satyrs and the inven-
tion of the black-ﬁgure technique and some new shapes, such as the
aryballos and alabastron. Proto-Corinthian pottery, most of which is
miniature  in  size,  was  the  ﬁrst  to  be  decorated  in  the  black-ﬁgure 
painting  technique  –  ﬁgure  silhouettes  drawn  in  black  and  ﬁlled  in 
with incised details.

cork:  a  buoyant,  light  brown  substance  obtained  from  the  outer  layer

of the bark of the cork oak.

corn mummy: a type of anthropomorphic funerary object made of soil
mixed  with  grains  of  corn,  which  was  usually  wrapped  up  in  linen
bandages and had a face mask.

corner notch: a major projectile form that is described as a point that
has had notches for hafting struck into the corners of the base; a ﬂaking
technique applied to accommodate hafting which involved the ﬂaking
of notches into the basal corners of a preform base. [corner-notched,
corner-notched point]

Cornish  urn:  a  Middle  Bronze  Age  pottery  vessel  found  in  the  south-
west  of  Britain,  dating  to  the  2nd  millennium  bc.  They  were  often 
barrel-shaped  with  a  highly  decorated  upper  body  and  with  strap 
handles. Decoration was in herringbone and lattice patterns. [Cornish
handled urn]

corrugated: shaped into alternate ridges and grooves.
corrugated  fastener:  a  fastener  used  in  making  light-duty  miter  joints,

such as on screens and large picture frames.

corrugation: a technique of decorating pottery in which the individual
coils  are  not  smoothed  on  the  outside,  thus  forming  an  overlapping
surface. Corrugation improves a pot’s heat conductivity.

cortex: a tough covering or crust on an unmodiﬁed stone cobble or newly
exposed ﬂint nodule and tabular ﬂint. It is formed by weathering and
is usually discarded during the knapping process.

cortical ﬂake: a ﬂake with its dorsal aspect completely covered by cortex.

[primary ﬂake]

cortical spall: a ﬂake struck from the surface of a pebble or nodule which
retains the natural cortex on one face. A cortical spall tool is generally
a relatively large, ovate cortical spall exhibiting retouch or use-wear
on one or more edges.

CRAMBECK  WARE

85

corundum: extremely hard crystallized alumina, used as an abrasive.
cosmetics: the earliest cosmetics known to archaeologists were in use in
Egypt in the 4th millennium bc, with evidence among funerary arti-
facts  of  eye  makeup  and  scented  unguents.  Both  Egyptian  men  and
women used oils, perfumes, and eye paints. By the start of the Chris-
tian era, cosmetics were in wide use in the Roman Empire. [cosmetic
(adj.)]

costrel: a type of medieval pottery ﬂask, of which the majority were made
of leather and have not survived. Merovingian and Carolingian pot-
tery costrels tend to be roughly round in shape, with a slight neck for
a stopper. The best known is the Zelzate Costrel, made in the Badorf-
type industries of central Rhineland, which contained a Viking period
hoard dating to ad 870.

cotter pin: a metal pin used to fasten two parts of a mechanism together

or a split pin that is opened out after being passed through a hole.

countersunk  handle:  a  rounded  handle  partly  sunk  into  the  side  of  a 

vessel.

cowrie: a variety of spiral shell from marine snails of the genus Cypraea,
in  which  the  opening  is  reduced  to  a  slit  running  the  length  of  one
side.  The  humped,  thick  shell  is  beautifully  colored  (often  speckled)
and glossy; the apertural lips, which open into the ﬁrst whorl in the
shell, are rolled inward and may be ﬁne-toothed. Its popularity in anti-
quity seems to depend on its use as a symbol of the female vulva. It
was widely traded, larger species being imported into Europe from as
far as the Red Sea. A cowrie-shaped amulet, known from predynas-
tic Egypt, was called a cowroid. [cowrie shell, cowry]

crackle  porcelain:  a  type  of  china  with  glaze  that  has  been  purposely
crackled or covered with a network of ﬁne crackles in the kiln. It is
caused by the shrinking of the glaze as the vessel cools after ﬁring and
is often the only ornament on this exquisite ware. The Chinese made
many  variations  of  this  porcelain,  some  rare  and  valuable.  In  some
examples there is engraved decoration under the glaze. The low-ﬁred Ju
stoneware is distinguished by a seemingly soft, milky glaze of pale blue
or grayish green with hair-thin crackle. A variant with strongly marked
crackle became known as Ko ware as it was made by the elder brother
(Ko) of the director of the Lung-ch’üan factory. [crackle, cracklin]

craft specialization: the making of crafts – pottery, jewelry, clothing, orna-
ments, stone tools, etc. – by specialists, that is people who do noth-
ing but make that craft.

Crambeck ware: a type of pottery that was widely distributed across the
north of England and North Wales in the second half of the 4th cen-
tury ad, including cream-colored mortaria and parchment wares, imita-
tion Samian forms, and gray kitchen wares.

86

CRATER

crater: a large, wide-mouthed, two-handled Greek or Roman bowl or vase,
usually made of pottery or metal. It is characteristic of Greece in the
Mycenaean and Classical periods. They were used to serve wine, mixed
with water in varying proportions, into individual drinking cups, and
handed out at banquets and sacriﬁces. The word is Greek for “mixing
bowl.”  There  is  a  classiﬁcation  of  four  types:  column  crater,  volute
crater, calyx crater, and bell crater, which take their names from the
characteristic shape either of the handle or of the body of the vase.
crawling:  a  defect  in  which  the  glaze  separates  from  the  body  during
drying or ﬁring (as around a preﬁring crack), leaving unglazed areas.
crazing: a cross-hatched pattern of fractures, observable on the surface
of a stone, as the result of excessive temperature exposure. In ceramic
analysis, it is a situation in which differential shrinkage causes the sur-
face of the vessel to crack while the remainder of the vessel wall remains
undamaged.

creamware:  earthenware  having  a  cream-colored  glaze.  [cream-colored

earthenware]

creaser: a ﬂat-edged blade used in leatherworking.

crescent: a crescent-shaped, bifacially ﬂaked stone tool gen-
erally  restricted  to  the  Paleoindian  period  and  almost
always  found  in  association  with  extinct  Pleistocene
lakes. They were possibly used for hunting large shore-
birds. [Great Basin transverse point]

cresset: a metal basket, mounted on a pole, in which oil or

pitch was burned for illumination.

cresset lamp: an open lamp which was ﬁlled with oil, then a wick ﬂoated

on the oil.

crest: a distinctive device representing a family or corporate body, borne
above  the  shield  of  a  coat  of  arms  (originally  as  worn  on  a  helmet)
or separately reproduced, e.g., on writing paper.

crested blade: a ﬂint blade with negative impressions of removals on one
side of the dorsal surface, creating a crest. These constitute part of a
previously  worked  striking  platform  or  result  from  preparing  the
ﬂaked surface on a core before detaching the ﬂakes or blades.

Creswell point: type of later Upper Paleolithic ﬂint tool found in the British
Isles  made  from  a  narrow  ﬂint  blade,  with  one  end  worked  to  pro-
duce a slightly elongated trapezoidal form, with the long side of the
blade left unworked, and the shorter side blunted.

critical point: the point in the drying of a clay article at which shrinkage
water has been removed, shrinkage has largely ceased, and the piece
is rigid and leather-hard. [critical moisture content]

Cromerian: an interglacial stage of northern Europe correlated with the
Günz-Mindel interglacial, part of the series of interglacials recognized

Crescent

CRUSE

87

in  Britain:  the  Pastonian  (oldest),  Beestonian,  and  Cromerian.  The
Cromerian stage is a group of interglacial deposits of the Quaternary
system that are stratiﬁed under Anglian glacial deposits and above an
extensive sequence of earlier Quaternary deposits. The type site of the
stage is at West Runton, Norfolk.

crossbow: a bow made with a crossbow parallel to the arrow and oper-
ated by a mechanical trigger release. It was likely invented by the Chinese
in the late Zhou/Chou dynasty (c. 400 bc) for defending their cities.
The best-preserved examples were found in Ch’u state. Chinese skill
in bronze casting enabled them to make an accurate trigger of several
interlocking parts increasing the weapon’s effectiveness. Cast-bronze
trigger mechanisms are commonly found in late Eastern Zhou/Chou
burials  along  with  inlaid  bronze  bow  ﬁttings  and  bronze  arrow
points. It was the most important weapon of the Middle Ages, with
its earliest appearance in Europe in Italian cities during the 10th and
11th centuries.

cross-dating: dating of sites by objects of known age, or artifact associ-

ation of known age.

crossed retouch:  retouch  that  is  so  steep  on  a  lithic  edge  that  it  forms
almost a 90° angle, so it is barely visible from the dorsal or ventral
sides.

cross-hatching: ornamentation formed by a criss-cross of diagonal lines,
described as acute angled if the angle to the horizontal is more than
45° and obtuse angled if less than this. [lattice decoration]

cross-section: the area that would be exposed if an artifact was cut in
half. In reference to a blade, it is the shape of the blade form if the
blade were cut across the blade and perpendicular to the length of the
blade. [see lateral section, transverse section]

crotal: an enclosed, round bell with a slit, sounded by a loose internal

pellet.

crown glass: a traditional window glass made by spinning a bubble of

molten glass on the end of a rod until it forms a ﬂat disk.

crucible: a small, coarse pottery (or other refractory material) vessel used
for  holding  molten  metal  during  smelting,  testing,  or  casting.  It  is 
usually easily recognizable from the effects of the high temperatures
to  which  it  has  been  subjected,  as  well  as  from  its  shape  and  thick-
ness.  Crucibles  were  probably  so-named  from  the  Latin  word  crux,
meaning “cross” or “trial.”

cruciform brooch: a bow-shaped brooch with a small headplate and long
footplate  with  three  knobs  and  the  footplate  shaped  into  an  animal
head with eyes and nostrils. Found in Jutland and Holstein from the
late 4th century.

cruse: a small earthenware container used for liquids.

Crucible

88

CRUTCH-HEAD  PIN

crutch-head pin: a type of bronze dress fastener of a simple shaft with
a short cross-piece set in the form of a T, dating to the 15th century
bc in southern Britain.

crystal: a material with atoms distributed in an orderly array (lattice struc-

ture), having characteristic optical and physical properties.

cuirass: a piece of armor to protect the torso, both front and back, and
often molded to the contours of the body. Originally made of thick
leather, it was variously made of laminated linen, sheet bronze, or iron,
or from scales of horn, hide, or metal. In Homeric and Hellenistic times,
it was made of bronze. Cuirasses of leather as well as iron were worn
by ofﬁcers in the armies of the Roman Empire. Later made of steel,
the cuirass was the forerunner to body armor worn to deﬂect bullets.

cult statue: the statue of a god or goddess, housed in a temple.
cultural chronology: the ordering of past material culture into a mean-

ingful time sequence.

Cumbrian club: a term for a distinctive type of large polished stone ax
of Middle Neolithic date made in northwest England. It has a broad-
butted form, long, narrow proportions, and a distinct “waisting” of
constriction towards the butt end. [Cumbrian-type stone ax]

cuneiform:  earliest  known  wedgelike  script  from  Meso-potamia  (from

Greek cuneus, meaning “wedge”).

Hymn to Ur-Nammu, cuneiform script on clay, c. 2060 BC

CUT  MARK

89

cup: a small bowl-shaped container for drinking from, typically with a

handle.

cup-and-ring mark: the commonest form of rock carving in the British
Isles,  consisting  of  a  cuplike  depression  surrounded  by  one  or  more
concentric  grooves.  Cup-and-ring  marks  are  found  on  standing
stones, singular or in stone circles, and on the slabs of burial cists, as
well  on  natural  rock  surfaces.  In  its  classic  form  most  cup-and-ring
art  belongs  in  the  Bronze  Age,  but  the  motif  occurs  on  passage
graves,  for  example  in  the  Clava  tombs  and  on  the  capstones  at
Newgrange,  where  it  may  show  links  with  similar  rock  carvings  in
northwest Spain. They are also found in Ireland and Scotland and can
be dated to the Neolithic period of the 4th to 3rd millennium bc. [cup
and ring mark, cup mark]

Cupisnique:  a  style  of  pottery  of  the  north  coast  of  Peru  during  the 
Early Horizon, and a local variant of Chavín culture. It is most often
associated with graves and is characteristically a polished gray–black
ware with globular bodies, stirrup spouts, and relief decoration. Early
Cupisnique tends to be strongly modeled by plastic manipulation of
the  surface.  In  later  phases,  red  and  black  banding,  separated  by 
incision and life modeling, especially stylized felines, appear. The style
dates  from  900–200 bc and  gave  rise  to  three  other  styles:  Salinar,
Gallinazo, and Vicus.

cupule: small cup-shaped marks deliberately put in a rock surface. [cup

marks, dots, pits]

curation: deliberate attempts by prehistoric peoples to preserve key arti-
facts and structures for posterity. These artifacts were reused and trans-
ported so often that they are rarely deposited in contexts where their
original locations of manufacture and use can be determined. [curated
technology]

currency bar: a strip of iron about 4 cm (1.5 inches) wide and 30–90 cm
(2–3 feet) long and pinched up at one end, which served as a unit of
currency  in  Britain  during  the  Late  Iron  Age,  before  the  introduc-
tion of coins by the Belgae. The bars may have originated as sword
blanks or roughouts. Their distribution was mainly in Dorset and the
Cotswolds, with some in the Severn Basin.

curvilinear:  contained  by  or  consisting  of  a  curved  line  or  lines;  these

designs employ ﬂowing, curvilinear forms.

cushion stone: a ﬂat-faced smooth stone used as an anvil in metalworking,

ﬁrst found in northern Europe’s Beaker graves.

cut ﬂooring nail: a nail with a rectangular cross-section and a blunt tip,

used to blind-nail ﬂooring through the edges without splitting.

cut mark: any microscopic scratches on the surface of an animal bone,
with distinctive V-shaped grooves. The marks indicate meat and muscle
were removed from the bone using stone ﬂakes.

90

CUTLASS

cutlass: a ﬂat, heavy, slightly curved blade.
cutlery: knives, forks, and spoons used for eating or serving food.
cutting  blade:  the  piercing  element  of  a  composite  projectile  point  or 

harpoon head. [end blade, endblade]

cutting tool: any tool used for cutting, gouging, shaving, piercing, scrap-

ing, and sawing.

Cycladic:  concerning  the  Bronze  Age  of  the  Cyclades,  Aegean  Islands,
equivalent to Helladic on the Greek mainland and Minoan in Crete.
It  is  usually  divided  into  three  major  divisions:  Early  (c.  3000–
2000 bc), Middle (c. 2000–1550 bc), and Late (c. 1550–1050 bc). In
the earlier Bronze Age, Cycladic culture seems to be largely independ-
ent, but in the late Middle Cycladic to early Late Cycladic, Minoan
inﬂuence becomes important. After c. 1400 bc mainland (Mycenaean)
inﬂuence  replaces  the  Minoan  and  many  islands  were  colonized  by
the  Mycenaeans.  Colin  Renfrew  has  proposed  an  alternative  Early
Cycladic subdivision into Grotta-Pelos, Keros-Syros, and Phylakopi I
– a culture sequence.

cylinder  hammer  technique:  a  stone-ﬂaking  technique  using  bone,
antler, wood, or other relatively soft material as a hammer to remove
small, ﬂat ﬂakes from a core during ﬂint knapping. These ﬂakes have
a characteristically long, thin form with a diffuse bulb of percussion.
[bar hammer technique, soft hammer technique]

cylinder  seal:  a  cylinder  engraved  with  a  design,  scene,  and/or  inscrip-
tion which was impressed onto the plastic clay when the cylinder seal
was rolled over a clay tablet. This was the standard seal form of the
Mesopotamian  civilization,  starting  in  the  Uruk  period.  The  incised
stone cylinder was rolled over a soft surface so that the design appeared
in relief. These seals were used to mark property and to legalize docu-
ments. Dating is based on changes in the design carved on the seal as
well as the seal’s size and proportion.

cylindrical tripod vase: a ceramic form popular in the Early Classic period
in  Mesoamerica  and  an  important  artifact  of  the  Teotihuacán.  It  is
cylindrical  in  shape  and  stands  on  three  slab  or  cylindrical  legs  and
frequently has a knobbed lid. [cylindrical vase]

cymbium: a small Greek boat-shaped drinking cup of metal or clay with

two handles.

dabber:  a  tool  used  in  etching  to  distribute  the  etching  ground  over  a
plate of metal in the ﬁrst process of engraving and, in printing from
copper plate engraving and woodcuts, to spread the ink.

(Necked–Beaker)

dagger:  a  short  stabbing  knife  which,  in  ancient  and  medieval  times, 
was  not  very  different  from  a  short  sword.  From  about  1300  the
European dagger was differentiated from the sword. In earliest anti-
quity, it was made of ﬂint, copper, bronze, iron, or bone. It is difﬁcult
to distinguish it from an inoffensive knife blade. Prehistoric daggers
were made in ﬂint by the Beaker Folk in the Neolithic–Early Bronze
Age, about 1900 bc. Bronze daggers, tanged for a wooden hilt, were
imported  by  Beaker  Folk  from  western  Europe  between  1900  and
500 bc. The fully developed style of the Iron Age came to be in the
1st century bc. In copper it was ancestral to the rapier, sword, spear,
and halberd.

dagger  ax:  a  bronze  Chinese  weapon  in  use  from  the  Shang  dynasty 
(c. 1500 bc) to the Han dynasty (206 bc to ad 220). The earliest forms
were broad and mounted at right angles to a wooden shaft through
which  the  tang  projected.  Later  forms  had  a  slender  blade  which
extended down the shaft at right angles to the main point to prevent
it snapping. [ko]

Dalton

92

DALES  WARE

Dales ware: coarse, shell-gritted, handmade cooking pots from the mid
2nd  century  ad onward  around  the  Trent  and  Humber  Rivers.  The
fabric is hard and coarse with a smooth but unpolished surface and
gray, black, or brown in color.

Dalton:  a  complex  of  the  late  Paleoindian  and  Archaic  periods  of  the
midwestern  and  eastern  US,  associated  with  the  Dalton  projectile 
point  class.  The  point  was  varied  due  to  reuse  and  resharpening. 
The Dalton sites indicate that hunting deer was important. Brand in
northeast Arkansas and Stanﬁeld-Worley Bluff in Alabama are the best
known sites. [Dalton point, Dalton projectile point]

damascening: art of incrusting one metal on another, in the form of wire,
which  by  undercutting  and  hammering  is  completely  attached  to 
the  metal  it  ornaments.  The  process  of  etching  slight  ornaments  on
polished  steel  wares  is  also  called  damascening.  Although  related  to
pattern-welding, this technique used in the manufacture of sword blades
probably  developed  independently.  First,  a  high-carbon  steel  is  pro-
duced by ﬁring wrought iron and wood together in a sealed crucible;
the resulting steel, or wootz, consists of light cementations in a darker
matrix, and this, together with a series of complicated forging tech-
niques at relatively low temperatures produced the delicate “watered
silk” pattern with alternating high- and low-carbon areas. Damascene
steel was very strong and highly elastic. [damaskeening]

Danzantes:  stone  slab,  bas-relief  carvings  of  Monte  Alban,  Mexico, 
dating to c. 100 bc to ad 100, that ﬂank the earliest ﬂat-topped slabs.
They  depict  nude  male  ﬁgures,  some  with  mutilated  or  elaborately
emphasized sexual organs, in unnatural dancing or possible swimming
poses. Certain elements of the iconography, such as thick lips and down-
turned mouths, indicate an Olmec origin. Associated hieroglyphs and
calendar dates support this theory.

dart: a ﬂaked projectile point hafted to a shaft that utilizes a throwing

stick, atlatl, or blowgun. [dart point]

data: relevant observations made on objects that then serve as the basis
for study and discussion; the four main classes of archaeological data
are artifacts, features, structures, and food remains.

daub: clay which is smeared onto a structure of timber or wattle (inter-
woven twigs) as a ﬁnish to the surface. It is normally added to both
faces of a wall and is used to keep out drafts and give a smooth ﬁnish.
The  material  usually  survives  only  when  baked  or  ﬁre-hardened,  as
would  be  the  case  if  a  structure  burned  down.  It  can  usually  be 
recognized by the impressions of the wattle to be found on its inner
face.  It  was  used  by  both  Indians  and  European  settlers  in  North
America to construct houses.

de facto refuse: artifacts left behind when a settlement or activity area

is abandoned.

DENARIUS 93

Dead Sea Scrolls: ancient Hebrew manuscripts recovered from ﬁve cave
sites  in  which  they  had  been  hidden  at  the  northwest  corner  of  the
Dead  Sea.  They  are  believed  to  be  the  religious  writings  of  the
Essenes,  a  sect  who  in  the  1st  century  bc and  1st  century  ad dwelt
in a monastery at Khirbet Qumran. This material, ﬁrst found in 1947,
is  extremely  relevant  to  the  origins  of  Christianity.  The  library
included all the Old Testament texts as well as sectarian works. The
scrolls,  together  with  the  excavations  at  Qumran,  have  provided
much information about the beliefs and way of life of the Essenes. It
is thought that the library was hidden in the cave in anticipation of
the  destruction  of  Khirbet  Qumran  by  the  Romans,  which  occurred
in ad 67–73. The manuscripts of leather, papyrus, and copper are among
the more important discoveries in the history of modern archaeology.
Their recovery has enabled scholars to push back the date of the Hebrew
Bible to no later than ad 70 and to reconstruct the history of Palestine
from the 4th century bc to ad 135.

death mask: a cast of a person’s face taken after death.
debitage: waste byproducts – chips or debris – resulting from the manu-
facture of stone tools, found in large quantities in a toolmaking area.
Study  of  debitage  can  reveal  a  good  deal  about  the  techniques  used
by knappers. Certain waste ﬂakes have a characteristic appearance and
indicate the tools that were made or prepared at a site even when the
tools themselves are absent.

debitage analysis: study of waste products resulting from tool manufacture

to reconstruct stone technology.

debris:  chips  and  chunks  of  lithic  material  removed  from  a  core  but 
that do not ﬁt the criteria for a ﬂake or blade – having no identiﬁable
platform and not being able to distinguish between dorsal and ventral
surfaces.

decal: a transferable decoration added to the surface of pottery begin-

ning in the mid 19th century.

decanter:  a  stoppered  glass  container  into  which  wine,  brandy,  etc.,  is

decanted.

decoration:  one  or  more  of  a  series  of  modiﬁcations  made  on  pottery

for purposes that are mainly nonfunctional.

deﬂocculate: to disperse in ﬁne particles, especially a ﬁne clay suspension,
so that particles repel each other and the substance becomes more ﬂuid.
delftware:  term  for  tin-glazed  earthenware  made  in  Britain  from  the 
16th century, named after the Dutch town of Delft. The main centers
for delftware were London, Bristol, Liverpool, and Glasgow, but the
factories went out of business with the introduction of creamware.

denarius: a Roman silver coin, probably ﬁrst struck in the late 3rd cen-
tury bc. A wide range of designs were shown and under the republic
they often bore an image of the moneymaker’s ancestor.

94

DENEKAMP  INTERSTADIAL

Denekamp interstadial: a warm period during the middle pleniglacial phase
of the last (Weichselian) glaciation (cold stage) in Europe. It is dated
to around 28,000 bc (30,000 bp).

denticulate: 1. An artifact (ﬂake or blade tool) with several small, tooth-
like (dentate or serrated) notches on the working edge. 2. Toothed by
retouch  that  forms  a  connecting  series  of  three  or  more  intersecting
notches along the perimeter of a piece. [denticulated (adj.)]

depas: Homeric term that Schliemann used to describe the two-handled
cups  which  he  found  in  Early  Bronze  Age  contexts  at  Troy.  [depas
amphikypellon]

deposition: any of the various processes by which artifacts move from
active use to an archaeological context, such as loss, disposal, aban-
donment,  burial,  etc.  It  is  the  laying,  placing,  or  throwing  down  of
any  material.  In  geology,  it  is  the  constructive  process  of  accumula-
tion into beds, veins, or irregular masses of any kind of loose, solid
rock  material  by  any  kind  of  natural  agent  (wind,  water,  ice).  The
transformation of materials from a systemic to an archaeological con-
text are directly responsible for the accumulation of archaeological sites
and they constitute the dominant factor in forming the archaeological
record. Deposition is the last stage of behavioral processes, in which
artifacts are discarded.

Derbyshire  ware:  a  type  of  British  pottery  c.  mid  2nd  century  ad
through to the 4th century ad with a hard and gritty surface containing
silica particles with colors from gray and light-brown to red; mainly
jars with a lid-seating on the rim.

descriptive type: a type based on the physical or external properties of

an artifact.

desert varnish: a chemical, dark-colored crust or ﬁlm of iron and man-
ganese oxides (usually with some silica) that is deposited on exposed
rocks,  artifacts,  and  petroglyph  surfaces.  Of  bacterial  origin,  this 
varnish becomes polished by wind abrasion and can be used in cation
ratio dating; its organic matter can be analyzed by accelerator mass
spectrometer radiocarbon dating.

design: any shapes, motifs, or symbols added as decoration on a ceramic

object.

design structure: layout or arrangement of a design; the way the surface
area to be decorated is conceptualized – whether subdivided or bounded
– and the arrangement of elements and motifs within that layout.

detritus:  debris  or  droppings  created  by  detrition;  matter  produced  by
the  wearing  away  of  exposed  surfaces,  especially  gravel,  sand,  clay,
or other materials eroded and washed away by water.

diachronic: referring to two or more reference points in time, especially
as they pertain to phenomena as they occur or change over a period
of time; a chronological perspective. The term refers to actions or things,

DIRECT  PERCUSSION 95

as in the study of artifacts in a region as they change across sequential
periods. [see synchronic]

diadem: a plain or decorated headband or crown of manmade or natural

materials, usually as a badge of status or ofﬁce.

diagnostic:  an  artifact  or  some  other  aspect  of  a  site  that  is  known  to

be associated with a particular time period. [diagnostic artifact]

dice: a small cube with faces bearing from one to six spots, used in games

die  stamp:  an  engraved  stamp  used  to  impress  an  image  onto  another

of chance. [die]

object.

digging  stick:  a  straight,  often  pointed,  wooden  tool  for  loosening  or
digging  up  the  ground.  It  was  used  in  food-gathering  economies  to
turn  up  roots  or  burrowing  animals,  and  in  Neolithic  communities
for cultivation until displaced by the hoe and later (in the Old World)
by the plow. It could be made more efﬁcient by adding a perforated
stone as a weight onto the shaft near the lower end.

diggings:  excavated  materials  or  the  site  that  has  been  or  is  being 

excavated.

ding: a Chinese tripod bowl with solid legs. From the Neolithic it was
made  of  ceramic  and  from  the  Shang  period  it  occurred  in  bronze;
there were also quadrapods. [ting]

dinos:  a  Greek  round-bottomed  cauldron  that  would  be  placed  on  a 

tripod or stand, probably used for mixing wine.

diptych: double-leafed tablets of metal, ivory, or wood, attached by strings
or  hinges.  Diptychs  are  common  in  Christian  archaeology,  often  as
alterpieces or paintings composed of two leaves which close like a book.
direct  measurement:  measurement  that  can  be  compared  with  a  stan-

dard scale, as on a ruler or Munsell chart.

direct percussion: a technique used in the manufacture of chipped-stone
artifacts in which ﬂakes are produced by striking a core with another

DIRECT  PERCUSSION

stone, a hammerstone, or by striking the core against a ﬁxed stone or
anvil  in  order  to  dislodge  a  ﬂake.  The  method  is  less  precise  in  its
results than indirect percussion. [free-hand percussion]

direct retouch: retouch that occurs on an edge of a lithic ﬂake, visible

only in dorsal view.

direction lines: nested series of curved lines drawn in each ﬂake scar to
indicate, by their placement, the direction of the blow or pressure that
produced that scar when the force detached a piece of the stone.

dirk: extra-long dagger, although not as long as a rapier.
discoidal: a stone artifact circular in shape and concave on both sides,
usually of quartz, granite, ﬂint, hematite, slate, or basalt. They range
from  0.25  to  23 cm  (1–9  inches)  in  diameter  and  from  0.5  to  9 kg
(1–20  pounds)  in  weight.  Some  have  a  hole  through  the  center  and
others  have  ﬂanges  around  the  edges.  They  seemed  to  have  a  cere-
monial or ritual purpose or were used for mixing herbs or medicines.
[disc, disk]

Discoidals

discoidal knife: a discoidal ﬂint tool that often has a ground edge.
discoidal nucleus technique: a method of core knapping used during the
Middle Paleolithic by which ﬂaking was done until the core was too
small to use. The Beaker People, in particular, made circular, oval, or
oblong thin ﬂakes of stone with this technique, which is very similar
to the Levallois technique.

dish: a shallow, ﬂat-bottomed container for cooking or serving food.
disk-core method: a technique in the making of stone tools in which a
core is trimmed to a distinctive disk shape and ﬂakes are then chipped
off for tools.

distaff: a rod around which ﬁber is wound for spinning.
distal: located away from the point of origin or attachment or a central
point. In anatomy, the part of a long bone (leg or arm) which is fur-
thest from the body; the opposite end is the proximal end. [distal end]
distribution: simply, the spatial location of archaeological sites or arti-
facts. More speciﬁcally, it is a deﬁnition of the spatial location of arti-
facts, structures, or settlement types over a landscape. Analysis of the
distribution  of  a  particular  artifact  type  may  lead  to  conclusions

DOLMEN

97

about the nature of the industry or culture which produced or used
it. The distribution of objects is studied by the plotting of an artifact’s
ﬁnd-places on a distribution map. This is the visual representation of
the distribution of some archaeologically signiﬁcant trait or traits. The
relationship of the ﬁnd-spot symbols to the natural environment may
reveal something about communication networks, the economic sub-
system,  and  cultural  or  technological  entities.  The  distribution  map
should show the extent of a culture of which the traits are distinctive,
outlying occurrences being explained by diffusion, especially if spread
along natural routes. The origin of more localized traits may be deﬁned.
The  overlaying  of  one  trait  on  another  may  suggest  association  or
sequence,  while  mutually  exclusive  distributions  can  imply  contem-
poraneity.  The  emphasis  is  on  individual  parts  of  archaeological
deposits rather than on the site as a unit. [distribution patterns, dis-
tributional archaeology]

djed pillar: in Egypt, a widely found amulet of roughly cruciform style
with at least three crossbars. It seems to have been a fetish from pre-
historic times and came to represent the abstract concept of stability.
Like the ankh, it was commonly used in friezes and painted inside the
base of cofﬁns.

document:  a  piece  of  written  or  printed  matter  providing  a  record  of

events, agreements, ownership, or identiﬁcation.

dog-tooth ornament: an ornament with a series of pyramidal ﬂowers of

four petals, c. 13th century ad Britain.

dogu:  a  type  of  clay  ﬁgurine,  most  often  depicting  a  pregnant  female,
made  in  Japan  during  the  Jomon  period,  c.  5th  to  4th  millennium 
to c. 250 bc. The function of these ﬁgurines is unknown, but it is gen-
erally believed that they were some kind of fertility symbol and they
are reminiscent of the rigidly frontal fertility ﬁgures produced by other
prehistoric cultures. Archaeological evidence suggests they were aids
in childbirth as well as fertility symbols. They are also found in simu-
lated  burials,  indicating  some  kind  of  ceremonial  function.  Fired  at 
a  low  temperature,  they  often  have  crumbly  surfaces  and  many  are
painted red.

dolium: a large Greek or Roman coarse earthenware vessel with a wide
mouth  and  spherical  form.  It  was  used  to  store  wine  and  oil;  later,
smaller vessels were produced. [culeus]

doll: a small model of a human ﬁgure, used as a child’s toy.
dolmen: 1. In antiquity (especially in France), a word for a megalithic
tomb  consisting  of  orthostats  and  capstone  or  for  megalithic  cham-
ber tombs in general. This was usually a stone structure consisting of
upright  columns  supporting  a  slab  roof  and  known  from  Neolithic
times.  In  English  archaeological  literature  “dolmen”  should  be  used

98

DOLMEN

only for tombs whose original plan cannot be determined or for tombs
of simple unspecialized types which do not ﬁt into the passage grave
or gallery grave categories; it is also used for relatively small, closed
megalithic chambers, such as the dysser of Scandinavia. The name was
probably derived from the Cornish tolmen (“stone table”). 2. The enclo-
sure for burial  in a jar  of the  Yayoi  period in Japan consisting of a
single large stone slab supported on a ring of stones. 3. A megalithic
stone burial feature in western China and the coastal Yellow Sea area,
dating to the 1st millennium bc, of which there are three forms – raised
table, low table, and unsupported capstone.

dolmen deity: a symbol of mysterious personage or divinity who peers
from megalithic and rock-cut tombs of western Europe. She is some-
times  represented  by  nothing  but  a  pair  of  eyes  or  eyebrows,  the 
oculus motif. Breasts and necklaces are female attributes often given.
The most detailed representation is on the French statue Menhir.

domed scraper: a scraper with a shape or structure resembling a dome.
Domesday  Book:  a  survey  of  land  ownership  in  England  after  the
Norman  Conquest.  The  Anglo-Saxon  Chronicle  describes  how  in
1085 it was decided to make a record of the number of hides in land
existing in each English shire and to establish the amount and value
of acreage and livestock possessed by individual landowners. The idea
was to create a new rating system which would protect and enlarge
the king’s revenue. The resulting document – a two-volume survey of
land ownership arranged under tenurial rather than territorial head-
ings – is the great testament of feudal England. The Domesday Book
is of fundamental importance to both historians and archaeologists of
the late Saxon and early Norman periods, as it gives the names and
sizes  of  villages,  farms,  manors,  churches,  and  other  properties  that
existed at the time as well as certain sales and transactions.

dorsal:  on  the  side  of  a  lithic  ﬂake  or  blade  that  would  have  been  on
the outside of the core (during striking) which shows cortex or scars
from previous ﬂake removals. [dorsal surface]

dorsal ridge: sharp ridge that marks the boundary between ﬂake scars

on the dorsal surface of a lithic ﬂake. [arris]

dotaku:  a  type  of  bronze  bell  made  in  the  Yayoi  period  of  Japan  that
was cast from melted bronzes, some heavily decorated. They may have
been used in agricultural fertility rituals.

double  ax:  a  shaft-hole  cutting  tool  that  had  two  opposed  (symmet-
rical) blades and was made of copper or bronze. With two cutting edges,
it did not have to be sharpened as often as a single ax. The best-known
examples are from Minoan Crete, where it was a practical tool and
a cult symbol. The stone battle ax is occasionally found in this form.
[double axe]

DUPLEX  HEAD  NAIL

99

downdraft  kiln:  an  installation  for  ﬁring  pottery  with  a  ﬁrebox,  in 
which the fuel burns beside the chamber in which the pots are ﬁred,
separated from it by a “bagwall” so that hot gas from the ﬁre must
rise over the bagwall and then pass down through the chamber before 
exiting  through  a  chimney  ﬂue  on  the  other  side.  It  achieves  high 
temperatures and better control over the atmosphere.

drachma: a Greek silver coin equivalent to six obols. In Athens, drachma

were often decorated with Athena’s head and her owl.

Drakenstein urn: type of Middle/Late Bronze Age ceramic vessel found
in  the  Low  Countries.  The  pots  were  barrel-shaped  with  impressed
cordon decoration on the upper part of the body and occasionally with
zigzag decoration. The shape and decoration of these vessels suggest
some contact with the Deverel-Rimbury wares of southern England.
drawing:  a  primary  forming  technique  for  producing  pottery  vessels, 
similar  to  pinching,  whereby  the  body  is  pulled  upward  from  the
center of a ball of tempered clay with the thumb and ﬁngers.

drawknife: a knife handled at both ends used to shave wood.
drill:  a  tool,  usually  of  wood  or  bone,  used  to  drill  holes  through  or

into other wood, stone, or bone artifacts.

drinking horn: a drinking vessel, usually curved in shape, fashioned out

of animal tusk or horn and sometimes with bands of decoration.

drinking tube: a length of hollow bird-bone used in aboriginal ceremo-

nial situations for drinking liquids.

dross: scum formed by oxidation at the surface of molten metals.
drum: a percussion instrument sounded by being struck with sticks or
the hands, typically cylindrical, barrel-shaped, or bowl-shaped with a
taut membrane over one or both ends.

Dryas: a series of cold climatic phases in northwestern Europe, during
a time when the North Atlantic was in almost full glacial condition.
Dryas I was c. 16,000–14,000 bp, Dryas II (Older Dryas) was c. 12,300–
11,800 bp, and Dryas III (Younger Dryas) was c. 11,000–10,000 bp.
It  is  named  after  a  tundra  plant.  The  increasing  temperature  after 
the late Dryas period during the Pre-Boreal and the Boreal (c. 8000–
5500 bc,  according  to  radiocarbon  dating)  caused  a  remarkable
change in late glacial ﬂora and fauna.

dugout canoe: a simple canoe made from a single tree hollowed out by

burning or chopping.

dunting: cracking that occurs in a ﬁred ware as a result of thermal stresses;
cracking that occurs if a ware is cooled too rapidly or that appears on
reﬁring bisque ware through 400–600°C, with the expansion of quartz.

duo-notch: point with a double set of notches.
duplex head nail: a nail with an upper head projecting for removal, used

for temporary work.

DYAD

dyad: a pair of statues, often carved from the same block of material,
either  representing  a  man  and  his  wife  or  depicting  two  versions  of
the same person. [pair-statue]

Dynastic period: a period of ancient Egypt’s history tied to a framework
of 30 dynasties (ruling houses) of kings, or pharaohs, who ruled from
the time of the country’s uniﬁcation into a single kingdom in c. 3100 bc
until  its  conquest  by  Alexander  the  Great  in  332 bc.  The  two 
Predynastic kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt were united by the 
legendary king Menes, possibly to be identiﬁed with the historical King
Narmer. The Dynastic period was followed by a Greek period when
the country was ruled by the Ptolemys, descendants of Alexander the
Great’s general. The Ptolemaic period and Egypt’s independence were
brought to an end in 30 bc when Queen Cleopatra VII died and the
country was absorbed into the Roman Empire. The political history,
largely derived from written sources, has a detailed and, for the most
part, precise chronology. From the 21st dynasty onwards, Egypt’s cohe-
sion broke, and from the 11th to 7th centuries bc Libyan, Asian, and
Nubian contenders vied with Egyptians for control of the state. The
divine ruler, the pharaoh, was ultimately responsible for the complex
bureaucracy  and  was  also  the  ﬁgurehead  of  the  ofﬁcial  religion,  the
personiﬁcation  of  the  sun  god  Ra,  counterpart  of  Osiris,  the  god  of
the land of the dead. Because of their belief in the afterlife, the royal
tombs  of  the  pharaohs  in  particular  reﬂect  the  great  wealth  and 
concentration  of  resources  at  the  pharaoh’s  disposal.  Much  of  our 
information  about  ancient  Egyptian  history  comes  from  the  records
that were carefully maintained by the Egyptians themselves, notably
by the priests who were regarded as the guardians of the state’s accu-
mulated wisdom.

E

ear: pointed or rounded projections from the base or hafting area of cer-

tain projectile points.

ear  ﬂare:  a  large  circular  elaborate  ear  spool,  ﬂared  like  the  bell  of  a

trumpet, often made of jade. [ear-ﬂare; eared (adj.)]

ear spool: an ornament worn in the ear lobe, sometimes of such weight

that the ear might be stretched to the shoulder.

Earlier  Stone  Age:  ﬁrst  stage  of  the  Stone  Age  in  sub-Saharan  Africa,
dating from more than 2.5 million years ago to c. 150,000 years ago.
The  earliest  artifacts  are  representative  of  the  Oldowan  Industrial
Complex, which was succeeded by the Acheulian Industrial Complex
between c. 1.5 million and 150,000 years ago.

Early Archaic percussion pressure ﬂaking: a type of ﬂaking in which the
preform was shaped by percussion ﬂaking. The blade edges were ground
to prepare a surface for the removal of elongate pressure ﬂakes. The
pressure  ﬂaking  may  have  taken  the  form  of  alternate  uniface  bevel
ﬂaking,  biface  serration  ﬂaking,  alternate  biface  bevel  ﬂaking,  or
irregular pressure ﬂaking.

Early  Bronze  Age:  a  period  in  the  Levant  dating  to  c.  3200–1950 bc,
just  before  Egypt’s  Archaic  period.  Increasing  urbanization  was
shown by the building of walled towns.

Early Dynastic period: a chronological phase in southern Mesopotamia
between c. 2900 and 2330 bc, ending with the founding of the dynasty
of Akkad. It was also known as the Pre-Sargonid period. The Sumerian
city states ﬂourished under their separate dynastic rulers – Ur, Umma,
Kish, and Lagash. The period is 3100–2450 bc on what is called the
“high chronology” (the other being the “medium chronology”). The
term  itself  is  derived  from  the  Sumerian  “king  list”  which  implies 
that Sumer was ruled by kings at this stage, although archaeological

EARLY  DYNASTIC  PERIOD

evidence  for  the  existence  of  kingship  is  meager  before  the  middle 
of the period. Traditionally, it is divided by archaeologists into three
subdivisions  –  ED  I,  II,  and  III  –  each  of  approximately  200  years’
duration. The royal tombs of Ur belong to the ED III period. The Early
Dynastic phase shows clear continuity from the preceding Jemdet Nasr,
and represents a period of rapid political, cultural, and artistic devel-
opment. Within the period, the pictographic writing of the earlier period
developed into the standardized cuneiform script. This period repre-
sents the earliest conjunction of archaeological and written evidence
for the history of southern Mesopotamia.

Early Horizon: a period during which the Chavín culture ﬂourished in
the  central  Andes  of  South  America  and  was  integrated  into  the
northern highlands and coastal region of Peru, c. 900–1 bc (also said
to be c. 1200–300 bc). It is one of a seven-period chronological con-
struction used in Peruvian archaeology. It coincides with the duration
of the Chavín style and its derivatives, such as Cupisnique. Following
this,  there  was  regional  differentiation  culminating  in  the  complex 
cultures of the Early Intermediate Period.

Early  Intermediate  Period:  a  period  of  development  of  distinctive
regional cultures in the central Andes of South America, c. ad 1–600
(also  said  to  be  c.  ad 300–600).  The  period  was  characterized  by 
nationalism,  a  full  population,  the  ﬁrst  large-scale  irrigation  works 
in  coastal  valleys,  interregional  warfare,  construction  of  forts,  craft
specialization, social class distinctions, and the rise of the ﬁrst great
Peruvian  cities.  Two  of  the  better-known  cultures  are  the  Moche 
and  Nasca  civilizations.  The  Middle  Horizon  emerged  from  these 
expansions.

Early Later Stone Age: an informal designation for the microlithic late
Pleistocene Stone Age industry of some sites in South Africa. One such
site is Border Cave, characterized by small backed pieces, bone points,
ostrich eggshell beads, and incised bone and wood.

Early Lithic: a term applied to the earliest stage in New World history,
when man ﬁrst appeared and started hunting and gathering. The period
is  characterized  by  large  projectile  points  and  percussion-chipped
stone tools suitable for the slaughter and butchering of big game.

early-stage biface: a biface in the initial step of manufacture, usually with

sinuous edges and simple surface topography.

earthenware: ceramics ﬁred at temperatures high enough for vitriﬁcation
to  begin,  usually  900–1200°C.  It  is  glazed  or  unglazed  nonvitreous
ceramic material, usually low-ﬁred, porous, and permeable.

east  Greek  pottery:  a  type  of  pottery  produced  during  the  Archaic
period within the Greek islands and on the western coast of Turkey
at Chios, Samos, Ephesus, Miletus, Clazomenae, and Rhodes.

EDGE 103

East Midlands burnished ware: type of Roman pottery, gray–brown bowls
and jars, dating to the 3rd and 4th centuries ad and found mainly in
the northeast midlands of England.

east Spanish rock art: an art style of southeastern Spain, found on the
walls of shallow rock shelters and probably of the Mesolithic period.
The subjects are lively scenes from everyday life, with warriors, hunters,
dancers, and animals. The style is unlike that of cave art, the ﬁgures
being small and painted in solid colors with no attempt at light and shade.
Eastgate point: type of projectile c. ad 500 during the late Archaic stage

in the Great Basin and western interior of North America.

Ebbsﬂeet: a small valley in southern England with an important series
of loams and gravels spanning the last two glacial periods and inter-
vening interglacial. Stone tools found have included Levallois ﬂakes,
but only a few hand axes and other tool types were found. The area
has also given its name to a decorated pottery style of the Neolithic
period. The ﬁrst Jutes, Hengist and Horsa, landed at Ebbsﬂeet in the
Isle of Thanet in ad 449.

Ebbsﬂeet ware: a family of elaborately decorated Neolithic ceramics found
in southern and eastern parts of the British Isles. Dating to the period
3000–2000 bc, Peterborough wares were divided into three successive
styles – Ebbsﬂeet, Mortlake, and Fengate – on the basis of their occur-
rence in the ditch ﬁlls at Windmill Hill. It is now recognized that these
three  groups  overlap  rather  more  than  originally  thought,  and  that
they are best seen as part of the broad group of impressed wares found
over much of northern Europe in the 3rd millennium bc. The decora-
tion on Peterborough ware consists of pits, “maggot impressions” made
by impressing tightly rolled cord, and the impressions made by press-
ing  the  ends  of  bird  bones  into  the  soft  clay  before  ﬁring.  Some  of 
the  later  vessels  are  the  ﬁrst  in  Britain  to  be  made  with  ﬂat  bases.

ecofact: nonartifactual remains found in archaeological sites, such as bones,

plant pollen, and seeds.

Eden  point:  Eden  points  are  known  for  their  exceptionally  well  done,
parallel pressure ﬂaking and diamond cross-section. The people that
made them were hunting large animals like bison. Eden points were
ﬁrst discovered in Yuma County, Colorado blow-outs during the 1930s
but none were found in situ until the spring of 1940 when Harold J.
Cook spent several days digging in a site discovered by O. M. Finley.
The Eden point was named by H. M. Wormington after the town of
Eden, Wyoming. The Eden type site was named the Finley site in honor
of O. M. Finley who discovered it.

EDGE  ANGLE

edge angle: angle of the cutting edge of a stone (or other material) tool.
The edge angle often indicates the purpose for which the tool was used.
Edge-wear analysis is the microscopic examination of the working edges
of tools. [edge-angle]

edge damage: result of use-wear on ﬂint; damage showing where a tool

was used.

edge-ground  stone  tool:  a  tool  classiﬁcation  of  Pleistocene  northern
Australia and New Guinea and Southeast Asia that comprises hatchets,
ﬂakes, and other tools. Important sites include Nawamoyn, Malang-
angerr,  Arnhem  Land,  Cape  York,  and  New  Guinea  Highlands.
Edge-ground tools do not appear until the Late Holocene elsewhere
in Australia; they are completely absent from Tasmania. In Southeast
Asia, they comprise ﬂaked stone tools which are sharpened by grind-
ing or polishing the cutting edge only. They existed in the Bacsonian
and Hoabhinian periods.

edge-modiﬁed ﬂake: a ﬂake with evidence of modiﬁcation along one or

more edges, whether by natural forces, human use, or bag wear.

Eemian: last interglacial of northern Europe, after the Saalian and before
the Weichsel glaciation, from c. 125,000 to 115,000 bp. This group of
Quaternary interglacial deposits are found right across Europe from
the  Netherlands  to  Russia  and  contain  fossils  that  indicate  warm 
conditions. In the Netherlands and northern Germany, the rising sea
level caused the deposition of Eemian marine sediments. Evidence from
bore holes indicates that the Eemian may represent two or even three
interglacial stages. Levalloisian and Mousterian artifacts are found in
Eemina deposits. The Riss-Würm in Alpine regions, the Sangamon in
North America, and the Ipswichian in Britain are its equivalents.

efﬁgy: an image or representation, usually depicting people or animals,
often made of pottery or stone – such as a ceramic vessel. Such vessels
were typical artifacts of the Mississippian period in North America,
c. ad 75–1540. [efﬁgy vessel]

efﬁgy pipe: small pipes carved in one piece from stone and then polished,
representing  birds,  ﬁsh,  and  other  animals,  particularly  from  the
Hopewell culture of the eastern woodlands of the United States dur-
ing  300 bc to ad 200.  In  other  areas  and  periods  of  the  US,  larger
stone efﬁgy pipes were carved in a variety of zoomorphic and human
forms, such as the human efﬁgy pipes of Adena Mound, Ohio.

eggshell  ware:  small,  delicate  beakers,  bowls,  or  jars,  usually  in  white
or cream, but occasionally black. The name refers to the sides of the
vessels,  which  are  typically  2 mm  or  less  thick.  Imported  to  Britain
in the 1st century ad and imitated locally. [eggshell glaze]

electroplating:  a  method  of  plating  one  metal  with  another  by  elec-
trodeposition.  The  articles  to  be  plated  are  made  the  cathode  of  an

Elko point: large, roughly triangular-shaped chipped stone points with
concave, straight, or slightly concave bases either with corner notches
or “ears” on the base. They are dated to 1300 bc to ad 700, the desert
Archaic stage in Great Basin and western North America.

elm decline: a phase in the history of northern European vegetation re-
cognized  through  pollen  analysis  and  dated  by  radiocarbon  as 
c. 4000 bc. It marked a sudden and marked decline in elm pollen in
contrast to other tree pollens. In some areas it was accompanied by a
drop in frost-sensitive species such as ivy and mistletoe, while in many
others it coincided with the appearance of plants associated with human
settlements (plantain and nettles). It is now attributed to disease from
beetles causing Dutch elm disease, though other explanations for the
decline include climatic change and human interference.

elouera:  a  backed  ﬂake  with  triangular  sections,  like  orange  segments,
which have polish from worked wood along the straight edge. These
artifacts are part of the Australian Small Tool tradition.

Elster/Elsterian: a north European Middle Pleistocene cold stage with at
least one glacial advance. It began c. 450,000–400,000 bp and ended
c. 300,000 bp with the Holsteinian interglacial. The British equivalent
is the Anglian cold stage; the Alpine equivalent is the Mindel; and the
North American equivalent is the Kansas.

emblem  glyph:  symbols  standing  for  royal  lineages  and  their  domains
in the Maya civilization; a Maya glyph identifying a place or polity.
Each of the principal Maya cities had its own hieroglyph, which appears
in  inscriptions  of  all  kinds.  All  such  emblem  glyphs  share  the  same
preﬁx,  but  the  main  element  varies  from  one  city  to  another.  Many
of these glyphs can now be linked to speciﬁc sites; others have still to
be identiﬁed. They were ﬁrst discovered in 1958.

emblema: a center panel with ﬁgure representations of people, animals, or
scenes  in  relief  in  a  Hellenistic  or  Roman  mosaic.  Emblemata  were
usually executed in opus vermiculatum, very ﬁne work with tiny tesserae
(stone, ceramic glass, or other hard cubes), and surrounded by ﬂoral or
geometric designs in coarser mosaic work. Although some emblemata
were large scenes with several ﬁgures, most were small and portable.
They were also used to decorate the inside of bowls, attached by solder.
The ﬁrst known emblema dates from about 200 bc. [emblemata (pl.)]

EMBLEMATIC  STYLE

emblematic style: stylistic variation that has a distinct symbolic referent,

embossing: raising of portions of a ceramic piece to form decorative or

such as a logo.

functional patterns.

enamel: a comparatively soft glass, a compound of ﬂint or sand, red lead,
and soda or potash. The materials are melted together, producing an
almost clear glass, with a slightly bluish or greenish tinge (ﬂux or frit).
The degree of hardness of the ﬂux depends on the proportions of the
components in the mix. Enamels are called hard when the tempera-
ture required to fuse them is very high and it will not decompose as
soft  enamel  would.  Soft  enamels  require  less  heat  to  ﬁre  them  and 
consequently  are  more  convenient  to  use,  but  they  do  not  wear  as 
well. Enamel was ﬁrst used in the Bronze and Iron Ages. It was often
melted and united with gold, silver, copper, bronze, and other metals
in a furnace. Enamel is colored white by oxide of tin, blue by oxide
of cobalt, red by gold, and green by copper. Different kinds of enamel
are:  (1)  inlaid  or  incrusted;  (2)  transparent,  showing  designs  on  the
metal  under  it;  or  (3)  painted  as  a  complete  picture.  The  various 
techniques  practiced  by  craftsmen  in  the  past  differ  mainly  in  the 
methods  employed  in  preparing  the  metal  to  receive  the  powdered
enamel. Some of those methods are cloisonné, champlevé, encrusted
enameling, and painted enamels.

enameling: process of applying enamel to something. [enamelling]
encaustic:  an  ancient  method  of  painting,  recorded  by  Pliny,  of  ﬁxing
pigments  with  heated  wax.  It  was  probably  ﬁrst  practiced  in  Egypt
about  3000 bc and  is  thought  to  have  reached  its  peak  in  Classical
Greece, although no examples from that period survive. Pigments, mixed
with melted beeswax, were brushed onto stone or plaster, smoothed
with a metal spatula, and then blended and driven into the wall with
a  heated  iron.  The  surface  was  later  polished  with  a  cloth.  It  was 
particularly  used  for  the  Fayum  mummy  portraits  of  Roman  Egypt.
Leonardo  da  Vinci  and  others  attempted  unsuccessfully  to  revive 
the  technique.  North  American  Indians  used  an  encaustic  method
whereby pigments mixed with hot animal fat were pressed into a design
engraved on smoothed buffalo hide. From the Greek for “burnt in.”
encrusted urn: a style of British pottery of the ﬁrst half of the 2nd millen-
nium bc, with a bucket-shaped proﬁle and thick, coarse fabric and heavy
decoration in horizontal and vertical bands around the upper body.
end scraper: a stone tool formed by chipping the end of a ﬂake of stone
which can then be used to scrape animal hides and wood. Its steeply
angled (acute) working edge was used for ﬂensing or softening hides
and to dress skins. It appeared in Europe during the Upper Paleolithic
period. It differed from side scrapers in that it had a rounded retouched

EOCENE 107

end and was often made on a blade. A side scraper had a retouched
working edge along the long edge of the ﬂake. [endscraper, grattoir]
endblade: a small blade tool, often bipointed and used to tip bone and
antler  arrowheads.  Triangular  endblades  were  probably  used  to  tip
harpoon heads.

Eneolithic:  a  period  in  the  Near  East  and  southeastern  Europe  when 
copper  metallurgy  was  being  adopted  by  Neolithic  cultures,  in  the 
4th and 3rd millennia bc. The period is called the Chalcolithic in the
Near East and the Copper Age in other areas.

engobe: a slip coating applied to a ceramic body before glazing to impart

a desired color or smooth texture to the surface. [slip]
engrave: to carve, cut, or etch into a material or surface.
engraving:  a  technique  for  decorating  ceramics  that  involves  cutting 

linear designs into the surface of an object. [incising]

enumeration: process of counting how many objects belong in each class

of a nominal scale.

envelope: a hollow clay ball of spherical, ovoid, or oblong shape hold-
ing tokens and usually bearing seal impressions. Clay envelopes dat-
ing from 3500 bc have markings that correspond to the clay shapes
inside. Moreover, these markings are more or less similar to the shapes
drawn on clay tablets that date back to about 3100 bc. These mark-
ings are thought to constitute a logographic form of writing consist-
ing of some 1200 different characters representing numerals, names,
and such material objects as cloth and cow. Tokens placed in an envel-
ope might have constituted a sort of bill of lading or a record of indebted-
ness. To serve as a reminder of the contents of the envelope, so that
every reader would not need to break open the envelope to read the
contents, corresponding shapes were impressed upon the envelope. But
if the content was marked on the envelope, there was no need to put
the tokens in an envelope at all; the envelope could be ﬂattened into
a convenient surface and the shapes impressed on it. Now that there
was no need for the tokens at all, their message was simply inscribed
into the clay. These shapes, drawn in the wet clay with a reed stylus
or pointed stick, constituted the ﬁrst writing.

Eocene:  a  major  geological  epoch  of  the  Earth’s  history  –  the  second
division  of  the  Tertiary  period  (Cenozoic  era)  that  began  about 
57.8 million years ago and ended about 36.6 million years ago (mya).
It  follows  the  Paleocene  epoch  and  precedes  the  Oligocene  epoch. 
The  Eocene  is  often  divided  into  Early  (57.8–52 mya),  Middle  (52–
43.6 mya),  and  Late  (43.6–36.6 mya)  epochs.  The  name  Eocene  is
derived from the Greek eos (“dawn”) and refers to the dawn of recent
life. During the Eocene, all the major divisions, or orders, of modern
mammals appeared.

108

EOLITH

eolith: any naturally shaped or broken stone, once considered to be the
oldest  artifacts  of  early  man.  They  consist  of  crudely  chipped  ﬂakes
and  cores  from  pre-Pleistocene  or  very  early  Pleistocene  deposits.  It 
is  now  accepted  that  eoliths  were  not  made  by  humans  but  were 
chipped  by  natural  agencies  as  far  back  as  500,000  years  bc.  Most
eoliths were frost-split chunks with irregular chipping round the edge.
Eolithic  is  a  term  sometimes  used  by  archaeologists  for  the  earliest
stage  of  human  culture  before  the  Paleolithic,  characterized  by  very
primitive stone tools, especially of ﬂint. It means “dawn of the Stone
Age.” [dawn stone]

Epicardial: an Early Neolithic pottery style of c. 5300–4600 bc which
was developed from the Cardial style in southern France. The decora-
tion is incised.

epichysis: a Greek or Roman wine pot or vessel with a long neck and

handle, used for pouring wine into cups.

epigraphy: the study of inscriptions.
epiphysis: articulating end of a long bone or vertebra; in an adult these
ends are fused with the shaft or main part of the bone, but they occur
as  separate  bony  masses  in  the  early  years  of  life.  For  both  human
and animal bones therefore, the state of fusion of the epiphyses can
be  used  to  determine  the  age  of  the  skeleton  if  it  is  under  20  years
old (human) or 3–4 years (domestic animals). [epiphyses (pl.)]

eraillure scar: small ﬂake scar on the dorsal side of a ﬂake next to the
platform.  It  is  the  result  of  the  rebounding  force  during  percussion
ﬂaking. [eraillure]

Erbenheim sword: heavy bronze, ﬂange-hilted sword with a leaf-shaped

blade, from the early urnﬁeld traditions of central Europe.

escutcheon: small metal ornamental plate or badge forming an emblem

or cover plate attached to a larger object or structure.

etched carnelian bead: beads with an etched decoration created with heat
after  a  design  in  an  alkali  or  metallic  oxide  paste  has  been  painted.
It was developed by the late Harappan period in southern Asia and
continues to be used. [carnelian bead]

etching: art of engraving with acid on metal; also the print taken from
the metal plate so engraved. In hard-ground etching the plate, usually
of copper or zinc, is given a thin coating or ground of acid-resistant resin.
Etruscan pottery: pottery produced at various centers in Etruria, especi-
ally  during  the  Archaic  and  Classical  periods.  Although  plain  wares
were particular common (Bucchero, Impasto), ﬁgure-decorated pottery
was also produced (Caeretan ware, Pontic ware).

everted rim:  a  rim  that  turns  sharply  outwards  and  upwards  from  the

shoulder of the vessel.

ewer: a large jug or pitcher with a wide mouth.

EXTRINSIC  ATTRIBUTE

109

excision:  removal  by  cutting;  the  act  or  procedure  of  removing  by,  or

as if by, cutting out. [excised, excising (adj.)]

excurvate: a shape that bulges out in a graceful smooth convex curve;
a term used to describe a convex blade edge or basal edge or stem.
execration  text:  curses  written  on  clay  ﬁgurines,  statuettes,  or  pottery
jars/vessels, listing the names of the enemies of Egypt – places, groups
of people, or individuals regarded as hostile or evil. These texts were
ritually  smashed  and  then  buried  as  part  of  a  magical  process  of 
triumphing over the persons or places listed.

expanded notch: a notch type which is composed of two notches in close
proximity that leave a nipple as a remnant. [double notch, “E” notch]
expanding:  in  lithics,  referring  to  the  width  of  a  stem  or  point  that  is

expedient  tool:  any  tool  formed  quickly  and  for  immediate  use,  often

getting larger or wider.

made with a ﬂake.

extrinsic  attribute:  any  attribute  of  an  object  that  is  not  inherent  in 
the object – its context in time, space, function, society, and the psy-
chological state in which the object was found, made, used, seen, or
discarded.

F

fabatarium:  a  large  Roman  earthenware  vessel  in  which  bean  ﬂour 
(puls fabacia) was served, boiled with water or broth and forming a
kind of polenta.

fabric:  material  of  which  pottery  is  composed;  the  body  of  processed

clay and temper additives in ceramics.

fabricator: a ﬂint implement or piece of stone or bone used in the manu-
facture of other ﬂint tools. Often rod-shaped and worn heavily on one
end, it is used to chip ﬂakes from a stone core.

face: broader area of a tool or projectile between the edges. This area

could include the blade and hafting area.

face  urn:  a  jar,  often  funerary,  with  a  human  face  usually  in  appliqué

on the shoulder; also ﬂagons with faces molded on the neck.

facing: an ornamental coating.
factorium:  a  vessel  containing  exactly  a  factum,  or  quantity  of  grapes

or olives to be placed under the press (torcular) in one making.

faience: 1. A name used for the medieval pottery of Faenza in northern
Italy, one of the chief seats of the ceramics industry in the 16th cen-
tury; it was an early type of majolica. 2. It is also used for the tin-glazed
earthenware made in France, Germany, Spain, and Scandinavia as dis-
tinguished  from  Faenza  majolica,  and  that  made  in  the  Netherlands
and England, which is called delft. 3. Most accurately, it is the prim-
itive form of glass developed in Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium
bc and then, almost as early, in Egypt; it is sometimes called Egyptian
faience. It is a substance composed of a sand and clay mixture baked
to  a  temperature  at  which  the  surface  begins  to  fuse  to  a  bluish  or
greenish glass. It was colored with copper salts to produce a blue-green
ﬁnish and used especially for beads and ﬁgurines, particularly in the
second millennium bc. Its main use in the Bronze Age was for beads,

FEEL

111

seals, ﬁgurines, and similar small objects. The glazed material could
be comprised of a base of either carved steatite (soapstone) or molded
clay with a core of crushed quartz (or quartz and soda-lime) ﬁred so
that  the  surface  fuses  into  a  glassy  coating.  Examples  occur  also  in
Bronze Age contexts in Europe, including the Wessex culture.

false relief: a form of excised or impressed decoration on pottery in which
two rows of inward pointing triangles are cut from, or impressed on,
the pot surface. The zigzag running between them then appears to be
in relief, though it is actually no higher than the surface of the pot.
fardo: in Peruvian archaeology, the package formed by a human mummy
wrapped  together  with  various  funerary  offerings  (amulets,  etc.), 
usually  in  several  yards  of  material.  Often  a  false  head  of  wood  or
straw or a metal mask was ﬁxed to the top of a fardo.

Farnham pottery: major Romano-British pottery industry based around
Farnham in Surrey, England, producing a wide range of wares between
the mid 1st century ad and the 4th century ad. Gray and cream-colored
fabrics predominated. [Alice Holt ware]

fastening: a device that closes or secures something.
feather termination: a gradual thinning of a lithic ﬂake at the distal end
to  an  extremely  sharp  point  or  edge.  [feather-edged  ﬂaking,  feather
fracture; feathered (adj.)]

feathering:  an  effect  obtained  by  trailing  a  feather  through  wet  slip 

decoration in pottery-making.

feature:  a  nonmovable/nonportable  element  of  an  archaeological  site 
carries  evidence  of  human  activity.  It  is  any  separate  archaeolo-
gical  unit  that  is  not  recorded  as  a  structure,  a  layer,  or  an  isolated
artifact;  a  wall,  hearth,  storage  pit,  or  burial  area  are  examples  of 
features.

fecundity ﬁgure: a type of offering bearer depicted on Egyptian temple
walls  which  is  mostly  seen  as  a  personiﬁcation  of  geographic  areas,
the  inundation,  or  abstract  concepts.  The  male  ﬁgures  have  heavy 
pendulous breasts and bulging stomachs, their fatness symbolizing the
abundance they bring with them.

Federmesser:  a  small  backed  blade,  about  the  size  and  shape  of  a
penknife blade; these blades were the most distinctive artifacts of the
Final Glacial peoples of the north European plain during the Allerød
oscillation (c. 9850–8850 bc). Similar bladelets occurred in the related
Creswellian culture of Britain and the blades are very similar to the
Azilian point. They are backed blades tapering to a point, and were
probably used as arrowheads. They tend to have curved or angled backs
unlike the earlier Gravette points.

feel: in pottery, feel is described as harsh (feels abrasive to the ﬁnger),
rough (irregularities can be felt), or smooth (no irregularities can be

112

FEEL

felt);  it  can  also  be  described  as  soapy  or  powdery,  referring  to  a 
surface in its basic state.

feldspar:  a  crystalline  mineral  consisting  of  aluminum  silicates  and

potassium, sodium, calcium, or barium.

Fengate  ware:  a  family  of  elaborately  decorated  Neolithic  ceramics
found in southern and eastern parts of the British Isles. Dating to the
period 3000–2000 bc, Isobel Smith divided Peterborough wares into
three successive styles – Ebbsﬂeet, Mortlake, and Fengate – on the basis
of  their  occurrence  in  the  ditch  ﬁlls  at  Windmill  Hill.  It  is  now  re-
cognized that these three groups overlap rather more than originally
thought,  and  that  they  are  best  seen  as  part  of  the  broad  group  of
impressed wares found over much of northern Europe in the 3rd mil-
lennium bc.  The  decoration  on  Peterborough  ware  consists  of  pits,
“maggot impressions” made by impressing tightly rolled cord, and the
impressions made by pressing the ends of bird bones into the soft clay
before  ﬁring.  Some  of  the  later  vessels  are  the  ﬁrst  in  Britain  to  be
made with ﬂat bases. [Peterborough ware]

fetish: an inanimate object associated with a spiritual being or magical
powers  and  worshipped  by  early  peoples.  A  fetish  differs  from  an 
idol in that it is worshipped in its own character, not as the image or
symbol of a deity.

fetter: a shackle for the feet.
fettle:  to  trim  rough  edges,  casting  or  mold  marks,  or  other  imperfec-

tions from dry or leather-hard ware before ﬁring.

ﬁber-tempered  pottery:  any  clay  pottery  to  which  grass  or  root  ﬁbers
have been added as a tempering material. This ware is the earliest pot-
tery in Caribbean South America and is the oldest pottery in the United
States, making its appearance in Archaic shell mounds in Georgia and
Florida before 2500 bc. [ﬁber tempering]

ﬁbula: in antiquity, a clasp, buckle, or brooch of various designs, usu-
ally shaped like a modern safety pin. It was often used for fastening
a draped garment such as a toga or cloak, and was made of bronze,
gold, silver, ivory, etc. It consisted of a bow, pin, and catch. It is the
Latin word for brooch, and is so-named for the outer of two bones
of the lower leg or hindlimb, which together with the tibia resemble
an ancient brooch. The earliest examples date to around 1300 bc. There
are two main families of ﬁbulae. In the south they were made in one
piece, starting with the Peschiera or violin bow form in northern Italy
and Mycenaean Greece. From this developed the arc ﬁbula north of
the  Mediterranean  and  the  harp  and  spectacle  ﬁbulae  in  the  eastern
Alps in the years around 1000 bc. From the Certosa form was derived
the long series of La Tène Iron Age varieties. Even wider variation is
found  among  the  succeeding  Roman  ﬁbulae,  leading  on  to  the  ﬁnal

FINAL  NEOLITHIC

113

forms  in  the  Saxon  and  Migration  periods.  Around  the  same  time,
there was an apparently independent development in northern Europe
of the two-piece variety. Fibula types include: violin bow, arc, elbowed,
serpentine,  dragon,  harp,  disk  with  “elastic  bow,”  leech,  boat,  two-
piece ﬁbula, spiral, La Tène I, and La Tène III. Fibula terms include:
catchplate, pin, spring, bow, stilt, elongated catchplate, disk catchplate,
and knobbed (Certosa) catchplate. Although primarily functional, ﬁbulae
were often also highly decorated items of personal adornment, some-
times inlaid with glass and precious stones. An enormous number of
different  types  of  ﬁbulae  were  made  and  they  can  often  be  a  useful
guide to dating. [ﬁbulae, ﬁbulas (pl.)]

ﬁcron: a long pointed, roughly worked biface with slightly concave sides

and a detailed tip. It may have preceded the Micoquian biface.

ﬁeld specimen: an artifact found during ﬁeldwork. [FS]
ﬁgurine: a small carved or sculpted ﬁgure of a human or animal, usu-
ally  of  clay,  stone,  wood,  or  a  metal.  A  ﬁgurine’s  purpose  is  often 
religious,  either  as  an  object  of  worship  itself  or  as  a  votive  offer-
ing  to  a  god.  They  were  made  in  prehistoric  Europe  from  the 
Upper Paleolithic onwards, though they became less common in the
Bronze Age.

Fikellura ware: an Archaic east Greek black-ﬁgure pottery style. It has
been  found  in  the  Fikellura  cemetery  on  Rhodes;  the  source  of  the
clay was Miletus.

ﬁle: a tool, usually metal, with roughened surfaces in the form of very

small teeth.

ﬁligree: a technique of decorating jewelry with gold, silver, or electrum
soldered  onto  metalwork.  It  consists  of  creating  a  ﬁne  open  metal-
work pattern out of wire, which is soldered together and to the main
body of the piece. The wire can be plain or decorative. For goldwork,
the solder is normally a gold–copper alloy (82% gold, 18% copper),
which has a lower melting point than pure gold. The word is derived
from the Italian ﬁligrana which is “ﬁlum” and “granum” or “granular
network.” It was ﬁrst developed in the Near East and was often used
in  combination  with  granulation.  The  technique  had  been  mastered
by the Early Dynastic Sumerian craftsmen of the 3rd millennium bc,
and ﬁne jewelry decorated in this way appears in the royal tombs of
Ur.  Anglo-Saxon  and  Germanic  metalworkers  greatly  developed  the
technique. [ﬁlagree, ﬁligraine]

ﬁller:  a  powdered  or  ground  substance  added  to  a  paint  or  sculpture
material  to  give  extra  bulk  or  body.  Fillers  for  resin  also  make  the
material opaque.

Final Neolithic: a transition phase where copper and bronze came into

use, but stone was still the most important.

114 FIND

ﬁnd:  an  act  or  instance  of  discovering  archaeological  remains,  the

remains discovered, or the location where this discovery occurs.

ﬁnd number:  a  number  assigned  to  any  object  found  in  stratiﬁed  con-
texts, indicating the unit of stratiﬁcation in which they were found.
Fine Orange pottery: a high-quality orange ware, often decorated with
incised,  molded,  or  black-painted  patterns;  a  late  Classic  (and  post-
Classic) pottery type of the lowland Maya area of Mesoamerica. Found
at sites under the inﬂuence of Teotihuacán, it comes from the Tabasco-
Campeche region (Usumacinta drainage). [Fine Orange ware]

ﬁneware: superior pottery with ﬁne textured fabric, thin walls, possibly

decorative, and usually tableware or for personal use.

ﬁnial:  an  ornament  at  the  top  of  a  gable,  canopy,  pinnacle,  or  similar

on a building or structure, usually of stone or ceramic.

ﬁnishing  nail:  a  nail  used  on  trims  and  cabinetwork  where  nail  heads

must be concealed.

ﬁnishing technique: a method for altering the surface characteristics of
vessels by displacing or impressing the surface material or by apply-
ing or removing material. [ﬁnish work]

ﬁre brick: a brick made of clay that is difﬁcult to fuse, used in boilers

and ﬁreplaces.

ﬁre hardening: exposure of a wooden implement to ﬁre in order to dry out
the wood but not char it. The tool becomes harder and more useful.
ﬁre  hearth:  a  ﬂat  piece  of  wood  upon  which  a  stick  (drill)  is  twisted 

ﬁre mark: a wall plate used by insurance companies to identify insured

ﬁreclay: a heat-resistant clay.
ﬁrecloud:  a  darkened  area  on  a  vessel’s  surface  resulting  from  uneven
ﬁring and the deposit of carbon in the pores during ﬁring, character-
istic of ﬁrings in which fuel and vessels are in immediate proximity.
ﬁre-cracked rock: rocks that have been cracked or broken by the heat
of  a  ﬁre.  A  common  element  in  aboriginal  campsite  debris.  [ﬁre-
broken rock]

ﬁred clay: any clay to which heat is applied.
ﬁre-dog:  an  instrument  consisting  of  an  iron  bar  held  horizontally  at 
one  end  by  an  upright  support,  used  to  ensure  the  proper  burning 
of a ﬁre. A pair of these were put at each side of the hearth or ﬁre-
place  to  support  burning  wood;  the  end  of  a  log  could  rest  on 
the crosspiece, which was supported by two uprights. Decorative iron

examples come from La Tène Iron Age contexts, mostly in graves. In
a kitchen ﬁreplace, the upright support might hold a rack in front for
the spit to turn in. [andiron, ﬁredog]

ﬁrestarter: a wood tool having a base with drilled holes and a stick that
is rubbed through the holes in the base to produce enough friction to
give a spark. [ﬁrestarter kit]

ﬁring: process of heating raw ceramics to a high temperature, driving all
the water out of the paste and (depending on the composition of the paste
and tempering) causing new chemical bonds to form within the paste.
First  Intermediate  Period:  chronological  phase  (c.  2130–1938 bc)
between the Old Kingdom (2575–2130 bc) and the Middle Kingdom
(1938–1600 bc),  which  appears  to  have  been  a  time  of  relative  polit-
ical disunity  and  instability.  The  period  includes  the  9th  dynasty 
(c. 2130–2080 bc), 10th dynasty (c. 2080–1970 bc), and 11th dyn-
asty (c. 2081–1938 bc). (The period corresponds to Manetho’s 7th to
10th dynasties and the early part of the 11th dynasty.) After the end
of  the  8th  dynasty,  the  throne  passed  to  kings  from  Heracleopolis,
who made their native city the capital. Major themes of inscriptions
of  the  period  are  the  provision  of  food  supplies  for  people  in  times
of famine and the promotion of irrigation works. In the 10th dynasty,
a period of generalized conﬂict focused on twin dynasties at Thebes
and  Heracleopolis.  The  11th  dynasty  made  Thebes  its  capital.  In 
the  First  Intermediate  Period,  monuments  were  erected  by  a  larger 
section  of  the  population  and,  in  the  absence  of  central  control, 
internal  dissent  and  conﬂicts  of  authority  became  visible  in  public
records.  Non-royal  individuals  took  over  some  of  the  privileges  of 
royalty, notably identiﬁcation with Osiris in the hereafter and the use
of the Pyramid Texts. These were incorporated into a more extensive
corpus inscribed on cofﬁns – the Cofﬁn Texts – and continued to be
inscribed during the Middle Kingdom.

ﬁsh hook: artifact of two basic types: the bait hook and lure hook. Varied
in form throughout the Paciﬁc, they are made of bone, shell, tortoise
shell, or wood. [ﬁshhook]

ﬁshtail point: a ﬂuted and stemmed, ﬁshlike stone tool of South America,
dating  to  c.  11,000–8000 bc.  The  complex  has  some  similarities  to
the Clovis of North America and is representative of the Paleoindian
time in South America.

ﬁt: dimensional adjustment of a glaze (or slip) to a clay body, speciﬁcally
with reference to their respective thermal expansions and contractions
and resultant stresses, which may cause ﬂaws in the coating. [glaze ﬁt]
Five  Dynasties  period:  in  Chinese  history,  the  period  of  time  between
the fall of the T’ang dynasty (ad 907) and the founding of the Sung
(Song) dynasty (ad 960), when ﬁve would-be dynasties followed one

another  in  quick  succession  in  north  China.  The  era  coincides  with
the Ten Kingdoms – the 10 regimes that dominated separate regions
of south China – during the same period.

ﬂag: a piece of fabric with a design, used as an emblem for military or

naval purposes, signaling, decoration, display, propaganda, etc.

ﬂagon: a large metal or pottery vessel with a handle and spout; used to

hold alcoholic beverages (usually wine).

ﬂake: a thin broad piece of stone detached from a larger mass for use
as a tool; a piece of stone removed from a larger piece (core or nucleus)
during  knapping  (percussion  or  pressure)  and  used  in  prehistoric
times as a cutting instrument. Also, any casual cutting implement typ-
ically consisting of large pieces of debitage detached from a core, not
“formed” tools. Flakes often served as blanks from which more com-
plex artifacts – burins, scrapers, gravers, arrowheads, etc. – could be
made. Waste ﬂakes (debitage) are those discarded during the manu-
facture of a tool. Flakes may be retouched to make a ﬂake tool or used
unmodiﬁed. The process leaves characteristic marks on both the core
and  ﬂake  which  makes  it  comparatively  easy  to  distinguish  human
workmanship from natural accident. [ﬂake tool, ﬂaked stone tool]

ﬂake blade: an imprecisely deﬁned, elongated, ﬂaked stone artifact with
dorsal ridges associated with sub-Saharan African Middle Stone Age
collections.  Unlike  true  blades,  ﬂake  blades  do  not  necessarily  have
parallel  sides,  nor  are  they  necessarily  at  least  twice  as  long  as  they
are wide. They were usually end-struck-off cores, frequently tapering
to a point to form artifacts termed convergent or pointed ﬂake blades,
and often with faceted platforms. Some examples were retouched to
form knives or denticulate or notched tools. [ﬂake-blade]

ﬂake scar: a mark or trace on a stone showing the point of attachment
of  a  ﬂake  that  has  been  removed;  the  point  where  a  ﬂake  has  been
chipped off in the making of a tool. [ﬂake bed]

ﬂake  scatter:  a  quantity  of  stone  ﬂakes  loosely  discarded  during  tool-

making, often found in a semicircle pattern where work was done.

ﬂaked stone: any object made by one of the various percussion or pres-
sure  techniques  of  stone  tool  technology.  Tools  produced  by  the
removal of ﬂakes (or chips, commonly referred to as debitage) from
the stone to create a sharp surface. Projectile points, bifaces, unifaces,
and cores are common ﬂaked stone artifact types. [chipped stone, ﬂaked
stone artifact]

ﬂaker: any pressure-ﬂaking tool, often made from bone or antler, used to
detach ﬂakes in stone material in knapping; an implement for ﬂaking ﬂint.
ﬂaking: process of making stone tools by removing ﬂakes from a larger
mass, by percussion or pressure from another tool. Percussion ﬂaking
is done by striking the stone to be chipped with another stone or bone.

FLAVIAN

117

Pressure ﬂaking is done by pressing a blunt-pointed tool of antler or
bone against the edge to be worked. Flaking is feasible with materials
that are glassy in nature and fracture evenly (such as obsidian or ﬂint);
it  is  not  feasible  with  materials  such  as  granite  or  sandstone  which,
in general, are ground.

ﬂaking tool: a tool, such as an antler billet, or antler drift, that was used
in removing ﬂakes during the manufacture of a ﬂaked-stone projectile,
tool, blade, or artifact. [ﬂaker]

ﬂan: a metal disk before it is stamped to become a coin.
Flandrian: of or pertaining to the period since the retreat of the ice sheet
and the rise of sea level at the end of the last glaciation in northwestern
Europe. The Flandrian can be dated by radiocarbon and ranges from
10,000 bp  (the  end  of  the  Devensian)  up  to  the  present  day.  These
deposits represent the latest Quaternary interglacial stage, equivalent
to  the  Holocene  epoch.  The  Flandrian  includes  sediments  similar  to
those  of  previous  interglacials,  and  deposits  on  archaeological  sites 
contain  Mesolithic,  Neolithic,  Bronze  Age,  Iron  Age,  Roman,  Dark
Age, medieval, and more recent artifacts.

ﬂange:  transverse  ﬂattening  of  an  edge  –  making  a  projecting  ﬂat  rim,
collar,  or  rib  on  an  artifact.  It  was  used  to  strengthen  an  object,  to
guide it, to keep it in place, or allow its attachment to another object.
The external ledge of a pottery bowl is often termed this.

ﬂanged ax: an Early to Middle Bronze Age style of ﬂat copper or bronze
ax that has the side edges of both faces bent out to form ﬂanges that
secure the haft in place and reduce the lateral movement of the haft
when the ax is being used. [ﬂanged axe, ﬂanged axhead]

ﬂared: having a gradual increase in width.
ﬂashing:  thin  rough-edged  projections  on  a  casting  made  from  a  piece
mold from which the cast metal has seeped or forced its way into seams,
joins, or cracks in the mold. On the exterior of a cast these are gen-
erally sawn off and ﬁled down.

ﬂask: a narrow-mouthed jar without handles.
ﬂat  axhead:  an  axhead  of  Early  Bronze  Age  date,  made  of  copper  or
bronze, which is ﬂat on both sides and generally lacks side ﬂanges or
other hafting aids. [ﬂat axehead]

ﬂat ﬂaking: removal of thin ﬂakes by striking the artifact at a small angle

to the plane of the face.

ﬂat  rimmed  ware:  a  type  of  Late  Bronze  Age  pottery  of  the  northern
British Isles with a coarse fabric, generally dark color, and distinctive
unornamented ﬂat-topped rims.

Flavian: period of rule of the Roman emperors Vespasian (69–79 ad),
Titus (79–81 ad), and Domitian (81–96 ad), who were members of
the Flavia gens.

118 FLEMISH  BLACK  WARE

Flemish black ware: a type of later medieval pottery known from paint-
ings of the Renaissance period. Some of the wares were well decorated
but most Flemish wares were coarse black wares with pinched bases.
They emerged from a Roman tradition of pottery making in Flanders.
ﬂesh hook: a many-pronged fork used in the sacriﬁcial services or a type
of  implement  found  in  Late  Bronze  Age  and  Iron  Age  contexts  in
Europe, often associated with bronze buckets and cauldrons.

ﬂesher: a tool used for ﬂeshing hides. In antiquity, it was often a long,
broad-edged tool of bone, antler, or stone used to scrape or rub hides
free of fat, sinew, hair, and other unwanted matter.

ﬂetching:  pieces  of  feather  attached  to  the  end  of  an  arrow  or  dart  to

stabilize ﬂight.

ﬂexible rule: a tool used to draw curved lines or to outline the shape of

an object so that its form can be drawn.

ﬂint: a type of hard stone, often gray in color, found in rounded nod-
ules and usually covered with a white incrustation; a microcrystalline
or cryptocrystalline form of silica containing some water and very ﬁne
pores, added to clay as an inert ﬁller or aggregate. A member of the
chalcedony group of water-bearing silica minerals, it was found from
early use to fracture conchoidally and was ideal for making stone tools
with sharp edges. It is chemically a quartz, but has a different micro-
crystalline  structure.  It  can  therefore  be  ﬂaked  readily  in  any  direc-
tion and so shaped to many useful forms. It occurs widely, and where
available  was  the  basic  material  for  man’s  tools  until  the  advent  of
metal; it is commonest “stone” of the Stone Age. The only types of
stone  preferred  to  it  were  obsidian  and  the  tougher  rocks  used  for
ground tools in the Neolithic. The term is often used interchangeably
with chert and also as a generic term denoting stone tools in the Old
World. Nodules of ﬂint occur commonly as seams in the upper and
middle chalk of northwest Europe. During the Neolithic and Copper
Age  of  Europe,  ﬂint  workers  recognized  that  ﬂint  from  beds  below
ground  were  of  superior  quality  to  surface  ﬂint,  especially  for  the 
manufacture  of  large  tools  such  as  axes.  These  beds  were  exploited
by sinking shafts and then excavating galleries outwards. Flint mines
are known from many areas of Europe and good examples occur in
Poland  (Krzemionki),  Holland,  Belgium  (Spiennes),  and  England
(Grimes Graves). [chert, ﬁrestone]

Flint  Creek  ﬂaking:  a  characteristic  ﬂaking  style  of  the  Flint  Creek 
culture which was accomplished by removing regular, deep, elongate,
opposing  pressure  ﬂakes  from  the  blade  edges.  The  application  of 
this ﬂaking style usually resulted in the formation of very ﬁne biface
serrations.

FLUTE

119

ﬂint knapping: technique of striking ﬂakes or blades from a large ﬂint
stone (core or nucleus) and the shaping of cores and ﬂakes into tools.
The most commonly used stone was ﬂint (chert), a hard, brittle stone,
commonly  found  as  nodules  in  limestone  areas,  that  breaks  with  a
conchoidal fracture. Flint knapping began with the simple striking of
one stone against another. Later methods include the use of antler and
wooden strikers for both direct and indirect percussion, and bone and
antler pressure-ﬂaking tools. [ﬂint-knapping, knapping]

ﬂint scatter: collections of worked ﬂint, stone, debitage, and associated
raw material gathered up from the surface of plowed ﬁelds or disturbed
ground.

ﬂintlock gun: a gun ﬁred by the use of a ﬂintlock. A gunﬂint is held in
the  lock,  which  on  pulling  the  trigger  pushes  back  the  pan  cover 
creating sparks that set off the powder in the pan causing a ﬂame to
go through and set off the charge in the barrel.

ﬂoat: 1. A cork or other buoyant object on a ﬁshing line as an indicator
of  a  ﬁsh  biting;  a  cork  supporting  the  edge  of  a  ﬁshing  net.  2.  The
hollow or inﬂated part of an organ supporting a ﬁsh, etc., in the water.
[ﬁshing-line ﬂoat, harpoon-line ﬂoat]

ﬂoating chronology: a chronometrically dated chronology that is not yet
tied in to calendar years. A ﬂoating chronology is a decipherable record
of  time  that  was  terminated  long  ago.  The  most  common  ﬂoating
chronologies  occur  in  dendrochronology  where  climate  affects  the
growth  of  rings,  and  sequences  are  local.  Local  sequences  cannot 
always be tied to the master sequences established in certain areas from
the present day back into prehistory, and therefore the local sequences
will  “ﬂoat”  until  some  link  with  a  known  historical  date  is  found.
Similarly,  in  magnetic  dating  many  of  the  sequences  will  ﬂoat  until
some independently dated sites can be entered on the curve. The term
is also used in reference to varve chronologies.

ﬂocculation: agglomeration or coming together of particles in a suspen-
sion,  such  as  a  slip,  forming  “ﬂocs”  and  causing  the  suspension  to
thicken or settle.

ﬂowerpot: a small container, typically with sloping sides and made from

plastic or earthenware, used for growing a plant.

ﬂue tile: open-ended, box-shaped tile built into the thickness of the walls

of a room heated by a hypocaust.

ﬂute: a channel or groove running up a pillar or running up the center
of a projectile point made of stone. In referring to projectile point arti-
facts,  the  mark  is  a  distinctive  longitudinal  groove  left  on  the  point
after removal of a channel ﬂake. It is characteristic of Folsom and Clovis
points. [ﬂuting (n.)]

120 FLÛTE  DE  PAN

ﬂûte de Pan: a type of suspension lug found on pottery of the Chassey,
Cortaillod, and Lagozza cultures. Several vertical clay tubes, of a width
suitable to take a suspension cord, are set side by side on the wall of
the  vessel.  The  lug  resembles  a  pan  pipe  or  a  section  of  corrugated
cardboard.

ﬂuted lanceolate projectile point: a stemless point with rounded edges,
a  channel  chipped  into  the  spine,  and  no  differently  shaped  projec-
tion at the base.

ﬂuted point: a projectile point with a distinctive longitudinal groove left
after the removal of a channel ﬂake; a long, medial channel notched
to  the  base  of  a  ﬂake.  The  channeled  ﬂake  is  removed  from  one  or
both faces by striking the specially prepared base sharply with a piece
of wood or bone. The sharp ridges of the ﬂutes were ground smooth
near the base of the point, to prevent them from cutting the bindings
when  the  point  was  inserted  into  a  notched  foreshaft.  These  points
have  extreme  symmetry,  careful  ﬂaking,  and  the  removal  of  a  long,
parallel and shallow ﬂake from one or both sides. Fluted points are
characteristic  of  the  Paleoindian  peoples  of  North  America  such  as
the Clovis and Folsom projectile points. [ﬂuted projectile point]

ﬂux: material used to lower the melting temperatures of, or promote fusion
between, metals or minerals – as in soldering, welding, and glassmaking;
also a substance in a clay body, slip, or glaze that lowers the melting
point of the mixture and promotes vitriﬁcation.

folding: a type of shaping in which the potter ﬂares a rim outward or
bends it inward and then rolls it down to double the rim’s thickness
or to create a complicated proﬁle.

foliate: decorated with leaves or a leaf-like pattern.
foliated point: elliptical shaped points, thin in section and pointed at both

ends; part of the Mousterian assemblages of central Europe.

Folsom  point:  a  distinctive  Paleoindian  ﬂuted  projectile  point  with  a 
single  ﬂute  on  each  face  and  ﬁne  pressure  ﬂaking.  Found  in  associ-
ation in sites around Folsom, New Mexico from c. 9000–8000 bc (altern-
ately 11,000–10,200 bp), they differ from Clovis points in the length
of the ﬂute, which extends over most of the point’s side. Folsom points
are smaller, with their widest dimension near the middle rather than
towards the base; they are more concave base than Clovis points, and
the edges of Folsom points were retouched. [Folsom projectile point]
Fontbouïsse: a Chalcolithic (Copper Age) settlement site in Gard, France,
which has given its name to a style of pottery decorated with chan-
neled decoration arranged usually in metopic or concentric semicircle
patterns. Fontbouïsse ware is widespread in southern France, occur-
ring in chamber bombs, village sites, burial caves, natural rock clefts,
and small cremation cysts. It is also the name of a cultural group known

for its dry-stone houses, megalithic tombs, and caves used for burials,
and is associated with extensive ﬂint mining and the ﬁrst evidence of
copper working in the area.

food  vessel:  a  series  of  pottery  vessels  found  in  northern  Britain,
Scotland,  and  Ireland;  used  as  the  name  of  one  of  the  two  main 
cultures of the Bronze Age. The Food Vessel culture was a prototype
derived from that of the Beaker folk and other Neolithic cultures. The
Food  Vessel  culture  people  were  hunters  and  farmers,  raising  sheep
and growing corn. They also sold bronze and other metal goods made
in Ireland. They buried food vessels with their dead (inhumation, in
crouched  positions,  buried  in  cists  under  cairns  or  barrows).  In  the
graves,  too,  are  found  crescent-shaped  necklaces  of  jet  and  shale
beads,  and  gold  necklaces  of  the  same  shape  (lunula)  from  Ireland.
Then  there  are  bronze  halbards,  axes,  and  daggers,  earrings  of  gold
and bronze, bone hairpins, and planoconvex ﬂint knives. The culture
is dated to 2000–1600 bc. [Food Vessel culture]

foot: an appendage attached along the circumference of a vessel’s base
to  raise  it  above  the  surface  on  which  the  vessel  rests;  the  base  of 
a  ceramic  vessel,  usually  a  ringlike  projection  formed  by  tooling  or
adding a coil.

foot warmer: any of various devices, such as a small stove, for keeping

one’s feet warm.

it to stand securely.

footring: a low pedestal-like ring formed on the base of a vessel to enable

foreshaft: 1. The front part of something, as of a projectile point. [fore-
shaft]  2.  A  pointed  stick,  generally  of  hardwood  or  bone,  mounted 
at  the  distal  end  of  an  arrow,  dart,  or  spear  and  often  tipped  with
ﬂaked stone.

forging: in metalworking, the shaping of a piece of metal by heating to

soften it, followed by hammering.

fork:  an  implement  with  two  or  more  prongs  used  for  lifting  food  to

the mouth or holding it when cutting.

form: physical characteristics – size, shape, composition, arrangement –
of any archaeological ﬁnd or any component of a culture. Form is an
essential part of attribute analysis. In archaeological research, the ﬁrst
objective is to describe and analyze the physical attributes of data to
determine distributions in time and space, which leads to form clas-
siﬁcations.  For  example,  the  shape  of  a  pot  or  other  tool  directly 
reﬂects its function. [form analysis, form attribute, form type, formal
difference, formal dimension]

form  attribute:  attribute  based  on  the  physical  characteristics  of  an 
artifact,  including  overall  shape,  shape  of  parts,  and  measurable
dimensions – leading to form classiﬁcation.

122 FORM  TYPE

form type: an artifact class based on form attributes.
formal context: afﬁnity of an object to a general class of objects shar-

ing general characteristics of form.

Formative:  a  cultural  stage  in  North  America  when  agriculture  and 
village settlements were developed, accompanied by pottery, weaving,
stone  carving,  and  ceremonial  objects  and  architecture.  In  the  New
World, especially Mesoamerica, it is also called the Pre-Classic period
and  preceded  the  Classic  period.  The  period  was  also  characterized
by  complex  societies  (chiefdoms)  and  long-distance  trade  networks.
In  Mesoamerica,  it  is  divided  into  Early  (2000–1000 bc),  Middle
(1000–300 bc), and Late (300 bc to ad 300). In Andean South America,
the period is usually framed within the period 1800–1 bc, and includes
the Initial Period and Early Horizon. It began with the introduction
of ceramics, which occurred c. 7600 bp in Amazonia and c. 5200 bp
in northwest Columbia.

formula  dating:  absolute  dating  using  artifact  attributes,  especially

applied to pipe stems and ceramics.

Forum  ware:  a  distinctive  green  glazed  pottery  found  in  the  19th-
century excavations of the forum in Rome. This ware has since been
found on many sites close to Rome, and in settlements of all types in
southern Etruria. Typically there are pitchers, often with incised wavy-
line decoration around the body of the pot. The ware belongs to the
late 6th or early 7th century, a phase of late Roman activity.

fossil assemblage: the part of a deposited assemblage that survives in a

site or locality until discovery.

fossil cuticles: outermost layer of the skin of leaves or blades of grass,
made of cutin – a very resistant, protective material that survives in
the  archaeological  record  often  in  feces.  Cuticular  analysis  is  useful
to palynology in environmental reconstruction.

fossil ivory: ivory furnished by the tusks of mammoths preserved in great
quantity  in  Siberian  ice.  It  is  the  material  of  which  nearly  all  ivory-
turner’s  work  in  Russia  is  made.  The  ivory  has  not  undergone  any
petrifying  change  like  other  fossils  and  it  can  be  used  for  artifact 
manufacture as easily as tusks from living animals.

fossiles directeurs: classes of lithic artifacts associated with speciﬁc time
periods and archaeological cultures of the European Paleolithic. [type
fossils]

foundation  deposit:  a  collection  of  objects  buried  within  the  walls  or
under the ﬂoors of a building to ensure the goodwill of the gods to
the householder(s).

founder’s  hoard:  a  collection  of  Bronze  Age  metalwork  deposited
together  –  the  tools,  equipment,  etc.  of  a  bronzeworker,  including 

FRYING  PAN

123

scrap metal, ingots, molds, punches, hammers, sets, gouges, anvil, and
polishing stone.

fracture  mechanics:  characterization  of  crack  growth  (fatigue  crack

growth, sustained load fracture, and dynamic crack growth).

fracture-based:  special  chipping  technique  that  knocked  off  long  thin 
slivers of ﬂint from point edges, usually done on the base bottom, and
occasionally on the lower shoulders.

fragment: broken part of an artifact.
frequency  seriation:  a  relative  age  determination  technique  in  which 
artifacts or other archaeological data are chronologically ordered by
ranking  their  relative  frequencies  of  appearance.  It  is  based  on  the 
idea that an artifact type ﬁrst steadily grows in popularity and then
steadily declines.

fresco:  a  method  of  painting  on  the  plastered  surface  of  a  wall  or 
ceiling  before  the  plaster  has  dried  so  that  the  colors  become  incor-
porated in it. The term refers to any painting done on freshly laid wet
plaster and left to dry with the plaster; the painting is part of the wall.
It was usually executed with mineral and earth pigments upon a freshly
laid  ground  of  stucco.  Lime  was  found  in  nearly  all  the  colors  of
Pompeii, which is part of fresco.

fretwork:  pottery  technique  in  which  the  wall  of  the  vessel  is  pierced
through to make the decoration; used extensively with puzzle jugs from
the 17th century.

friability: ability of something to be crumbled.
frieze: a decorative band or feature, such as a long band of relief sculp-
ture  decorating  the  upper  stonework  of  a  temple.  It  is  the  zone 
above the epistyle, decorated with triglyphs and metopes in Doric order 
architecture  or  sculpture  or  dentils  in  Ionic  order  architecture.  This
type of band of decoration on a wall or vessel may be painted or in
bas-relief.

frilling: a crust decoration found on tazzae.
frit: vitreous compound from which soft porcelain is made; the fusible
ceramic mixture used to make glazes and enamels for dinnerware and
metallic surfaces. In the manufacture of glaze, the oxides are normally
suspended in water for application but some compounds (e.g., potas-
sium  and  sodium)  are  very  water-soluble  and  if  applied  directly
would be absorbed into the pot. Therefore, the raw materials are fused
together under heat to form an insoluble glass known as frit. The frit
is powdered, suspended in water, and applied to the pot.

frying pan: a term used to describe any shallow, circular vessel or bowl
with a decorated base found in the Early Bronze Age of the Cyclades,
especially the Cycladic Grotta-Pelos and Keros-Syros cultures. Made

124 FRYING  PAN

of  clay,  the  handle  was  split  into  two  knoblike  projections  and  the
stamped  or  incised  decoration  often  included  spirals.  The  vessel’s 
purpose is unknown, perhaps ritual but not for cooking. It has been
suggested that when ﬁlled with water they were used as mirrors. The
resemblance to a frying pan is superﬁcial and certainly misleading.

Fuchsberg:  a  Neolithic  pottery  style  of  the  Danish  Early  and  Middle
Neolithic, c. 3400 bc. It was characterized by rich, incised decoration
and has been found at Sarup and Toftum.

fulcrum:  in  Roman  antiquity,  the  curved  raised  end  of  a  Roman  ban-

quet couch.

Fulton  turkey  tail  point:  a  leaf-shaped,  side-notched  point  –  with
notches chipped into each side of the base to form a stem below the
main part of the point, generally 95–150 mm (3.75–6 inches) long.
fumed: of a vessel, having a dark surface, especially black-burnished ware
which  has  been  exposed  to  a  reducing  atmosphere  during  the  later
stages of manufacture.

function: purpose or use of a component within a culture. The second
goal of archaeological research is the analysis of data and their rela-
tionships  to  determine  function  and  thus  reconstruct  and  create 
synchronic descriptions of ancient behavior. It is a model of culture
that is keyed to the functions of its various components, which unite
into a single system or structure.

functional  attribute:  any  characteristic  of  an  object  that  indicates  its 
function, such as its form or a residue from an activity for which it
was used.

functional type: a type based on cultural use or function rather than on

outward form or chronological position.

funeral  urn:  receptacle  in  which  the  ashes  are  placed  after  cremation.

[funeral pot]

funerary cone: Egyptian solid pottery cones, 10–30 cm (4–12 inches) in
length,  which  were  placed  at  the  entrances  to  tombs,  often  with 
the  name  and  titles  of  the  deceased  on  the  ﬂat,  circular  end.  Found
mainly in the Theban area of Middle Kingdom to Late Period dates
(2125–332 bc), these cones were originally inserted in the brick-built
tomb facade or tomb pyramid to form horizontal rows. Most belong
to the New Kingdom and the bulk of them to the 18th dynasty (1550–
1295 bc).

funerary  monument:  in  many  cultures  and  civilizations  the  tomb  was
superseded by, or coexisted with, monuments or memorials to the dead.
This foreshadowed a general revival of the Greek practice of erecting
funerary monuments, rather than tombs, during the 16th century.

funerary  offering:  any  items  provided  initially  by  mourners  and  later,
magically, through inscriptions and pictures in the tomb. Funerary offer-

FUSTÁT,  AL-

125

ings are essential for the well being of the “ka” in Egyptian tradition.
Funerary offerings present rich documentary evidence of a culture.

funnel  beaker:  a  vessel  with  a  globular  body  and  expanded  neck, 
characteristic  of  the  Early  and  Middle  Neolithic  culture  of  northern
Europe.  The  funnel  beaker  is  not  directly  related  to  the  bell  beaker 
of  central  and  western  Europe.  The  complex  Funnel  beaker  culture
represents  the  ﬁrst  agriculturists  in  Scandinavia  and  the  north
European plain, appearing from 3500 bc onwards. It is named after
the  characteristic  pottery,  which  is  often  found  in  megalithic  tombs
in  northern  Germany.  [funnelneck  beaker,  Funnel-necked  beaker 
culture, TRB, trichterbecher]

furrowing: decoration made by drawing the ﬁngers or a tool across the
body of a vessel, resulting in either a series of horizontal grooves or
groups of striations.

fusible clay: clay capable of being melted and fused.
Fustát,  al-:  capital  of  the  Muslim  province  of  Egypt  during  the
Umayyad and ‘Abbasid caliphates, and under succeeding dynasties, until
captured  by  the  Fatimid  Jawhar  in  ad 969.  Founded  in  641  by  the
Muslim conqueror of Egypt, ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, on the east bank of the
Nile,  south  of  modern  Cairo,  al-Fustát  was  the  earliest  Arab  settle-
ment in Egypt and site of the province’s ﬁrst mosque, Jami’ ‘Amr. It
was  burnt  to  the  ground  in  1168,  and  was  rebuilt  by  Saladin,  who
joined it with Cairo. Fustat ware is a style of pottery originating from
al-Fustát. Characteristic qualities are the white glaze and pigments rang-
ing  from  lemon  to  intense  copper  in  color.  Some  pieces  are  incised
and covered with transparent glaze. [al-Fostat]

G

gadroon:  a  decorative  pattern  used  in  the  ornamentation  of  gold  and
silver metalwork and pottery, consisting of an embossed tear shape.
A gadroon is one of a set of convex curves or arcs joined at their ends
to form this pattern, usually one of a series radiating from the base
of a work.

Gallinazo:  a  pottery  style  and  culture  of  the  ﬁrst  phase  of  the  Early
Intermediate Period, ﬂourishing c. 200 bc to ad 200 on the north cen-
tral coast of Peru (Virú Valley). Together with the slightly earlier Salinar,
the  Gallinazo  culture  is  seen  as  transitional  from  Chavín-associated
groups, such as Cupisnique, to the rise of the Moche state. It is related
to the contemporary Recuay style of the highlands. The best-known
Gallinazo  pottery  is  black-on-orange  negative  resist  decorated  ware.
The type site appears to have been a ceremonial center with a nucleus
of adobe mounds and walled courtyards. Residential apartment com-
plexes are scattered over an area around the center; it was abandoned
some time after the rise of Moche.

Gallo-Belgic ware: vessels imported from Gaul around late 1st century
bc and early 1st century ad, usually in black or silver-gray (terra nigra),
or white fabric coated with red slip (terra rubra), or a dense white or
cream fabric. The vessels often have the name of the potter stamped
on the inner surface of the base.

gastrolith: a stone or pebble ingested by a ﬁsh, reptile, or bird for the

purpose of grinding food to aid digestion.

gauge:  a  graduated  vessel  or  instrument  for  gauging  or  measuring  the
force or quantity of a ﬂuctuating object, such as rainfall, tide, wind, etc.

gauntlet: armored covering to protect the hand and wrist.
ge:  a  dagger  ax,  the  characteristic  weapon  of  the  Chinese  Bronze 
Age  during  the  Shang  dynasty  and  then  made  from  iron  from  the
Zhou/Chou dynasty onwards. The dagger-shaped bronze blade, usu-

GEOMETRICS 127

ally with a ﬂat tang but occasionally with a shaft hole, was mounted
perpendicular to the wooden shaft. The blade had a cross-piece par-
allel to the shaft to help hold it in place. Bronze Age blades and non-
functional  jade  replicas  of  blades  often  appear  as  mortuary  gifts  in
Shang  tombs.  The  earliest  ge  yet  known  have  come  from  Erlitou, 
c. mid 2nd millennium bc. In the Eastern Zhou/Chou period the ge
was sometimes combined with a spear, the ge blade at right angles to
the spearhead, to form a ji. The ji was in existence by the late 6th or
early 5th century bc. They are chopping implements. [ko]

gem  point:  a  projectile  point  made  out  of  agate,  jasper,  or  another 

colorful stone. [gempoint]

gemstone: a precious or semiprecious stone used in jewelry.
geofact: a naturally shaped stone that resembles an artifact.
geoglyph: any ground-constructed example of rock art, such as intaglios
or rock alignments; straight lines, geometric shapes, and other repres-
entative designs found on the desert plain. Geoglyphs can be formed
by piling up materials on the ground surface or by removing surface
materials and most suggest a largely ceremonial function. [Nasca lines;
Nazca lines]

geometric, Geometric: a style of decoration with repeated geometric motifs
–  circles,  squares,  triangles,  lozenges,  and  running  linear  patterns  –
ﬂourishing in Greece c. 900–700 bc. The term is also applied to such
designs  on  wall  painting  or  textiles.  The  style  derived  from  the  tri-
angular, circular, meander, zigzags, rhomboids, and other linear decora-
tion  on  Greek  pottery  of  this  period.  In  Classical  Greek  art  history,
the  term  is  used  speciﬁcally  of  the  early  phases  of  vase  painting 
as, for example, Protogeometric (c. 1050–900 bc), Geometric (c. 900–
750 bc), and Late Geometric (c. 750–700 bc). When the term is applied
to the period of Greek history in which the decoration ﬂourished, it
is  often  extended  to  1100–700 bc,  after  the  fall  of  the  Mycenaean 
civilization and marking the transition from the Bronze to Iron Age.
The ﬁrst phase, called Protogeometric, corresponds to the dark ages
when Greek culture was inward looking and very poor. Its ﬁnal phase,
the Late Geometric, coincided with the resumption of relations with
Asian cultures and the beginning of colonization of the northern, south-
ern, and western shores of the Mediterranean.

geometric pottery: well-ﬁred, stamp-impressed pottery characteristic of
c.  2000 bc to ad 300  sites  in  south  and  southeastern  China.  The
Geometric pottery cultures seem to have grown out of local Neolithic
predecessors and characterize the protohistoric Wucheng, Hushu, and
Maqiao cultures of the region.

geometrics: a general category of artifacts that includes lunates (crescent
shaped), triangles (three sides), trapezes (four sizes, two approximately
parallel), and rectangles (four sides) – generally very small tools, usually

less than 2.5 cm (1 inch) long and with the shapes formed by back-
ing and a sharp cutting edge.

gesso: material consisting of a layer of ﬁne plaster to which gilding was
often attached using an adhesive. It was a ﬂuid, white coating com-
posed of plaster of Paris, chalk, gypsum, or other whiting mixed with
glue, applied to smooth surfaces such as wood panels, plaster, stone,
or canvas to provide the ground for tempera and oil painting or for
gilding and painting carved furniture and picture frames. In medieval
and Renaissance tempera painting, the surface was covered ﬁrst with
a layer of gesso grosso (rough gesso) made with coarse, unslaked plas-
ter, then with a series of layers of gesso sottile (ﬁnishing gesso) made
with ﬁne plaster slaked in water, which produced an opaque, white,
reﬂective surface. [chalk, gypsum]

gilding:  art  of  decorating  with  a  thin  layer  of  gold  paint  or  gold  leaf.
The term includes the application of silver, palladium, aluminum, and
copper alloys.

gimlet:  a  small  tool  for  boring  holes  with  a  cross  handle  and  a  screw

tip.

girth beaker: a vertical-sided beaker with horizontal bands of corruga-
tions,  cordons,  or  latticing  of  the  mid  1st  century  ad,  of  Britain  or
Gallo-Belgic origin.

girth  groove:  in  ceramics,  a  continuous  horizontal  groove  around  the

belly of a vessel.

gisant:  in  sepulchral  sculpture,  an  efﬁgy  representing  the  person  in
death; especially an efﬁgy depicting the deceased in a state of advanced
decomposition.  It  was  popular  in  15th-  and  16th-century  northern
Europe. The gisant was often placed below a portrait, or orant, which
represented  the  person  praying  or  kneeling,  as  in  life.  It  was  a
reminder of the transitory nature of life.

glacial:  any  of  a  number  of  cold  climatic  periods  in  which  there  was

widespread ice and cold-climate ﬂora and fauna.

glaciation: process by which land is covered by continental and Alpine
glacier  ice  sheets  or  the  period  of  time  during  which  such  covering
occurred; several glaciations are required to make up an ice age (such
as the Pleistocene). The land is subject to erosion and deposition by
this process, which occurred repeatedly during the Quaternary; the pro-
cess modiﬁes landscapes and affects the level of ocean basins. These
periods  of  colder  weather  are  also  called  glacials,  and  the  warmer 
periods  between  them  interglacials.  At  the  onset  of  colder  weather,
water is taken up into the ice sheets and glaciers, causing a drop in
sea  level.  Landscapes  once  covered  by  ice  can  be  recognized  by  the
smooth rock surfaces and the U-shaped valleys formed by the ice sheets
and glaciers and the rock rubble carried along in them. As the climate

GLASS

129

warmed, the glaciers retreated, the ice melted, and the sea level rose.
The ice also deposited various forms of boulder clays, and banks of
debris at the sides and ends of glaciers, known as moraines. Beyond
the limits of glaciers and ice sheets, extensive layers of outwash sands
and gravels were deposited; where these deposits occur in lakes they
are  called  varves.  The  periglacial  zone  around  the  margin  of  an  ice
sheet has permanently frozen subsoil, and is occupied by cold-loving
plants and animals. Erosion was mainly brought about by soliﬂuxion.
The low temperatures and the constant freezing and thawing also affect
the soil; these frost effects are called cryoturbation. Particularly char-
acteristic  are  ice  wedges,  polygonal  cracks  in  the  ground  frequently
recognizable in air photographs. They are caused by the shrinking of
the ground at low temperatures and the ﬁlling of the cracks with water,
which subsequently expand on freezing to open the crack still further.
The last 2 million years have been marked by a series of such glacia-
tions. Broad correlations between the glaciation schemes in different
parts  of  Europe  and  North  America  exist.  Four  ice  ages  have  been
ﬁgured; in Europe, the ﬁrst glaciation was at a climax 550,000 years
ago.  This  gradually  gave  way  to  the  ﬁrst  interglacial  (Gunz-Mindel)
period lasting about 60,000 years in which warm conditions again pre-
vailed. The second glaciation came along with its climax 450,000 years
ago, and the second interglacial (Mindel-Riss) period followed, last-
ing 200,000 years. The third glacial (Riss) period climax 185,000 years
ago was relieved by 60,000 years of interglacial warmth. The fourth
(Wurm) and last ice age was at its height 72,000 years ago. The term
has also commonly been used to describe the periods of generally cold
climate that occurred at intervals during the Quaternary period. It is,
however, now clear that ice sheets grew only during parts of these so-
called “glacials” (e.g., the Devensian). For this reason, the term “cold
stage” is preferable.

glaive: a weapon consisting of a blade ﬁxed to a long handle.
glass: a hard, amorphous, inorganic, usually transparent, brittle substance
made  by  fusing  silicates,  sometimes  borates  and  phosphates,  with 
certain  basic  oxides  and  then  rapidly  cooling  to  prevent  crystalliza-
tion. It was ﬁrst developed from faience about 4000 years ago in the
Near  East,  but  was  rarely  used  for  anything  larger  than  beads  until
Hellenistic and Roman times. Glass bottles in Egypt are represented
on monuments of the 4th dynasty (at least 2000 bc). A vase of greenish
glass found at Nineveh dates to 700 bc. Glass is in the windows at
Pompeii  and  the  Romans  stained  it,  blew  it,  worked  it  on  lathes, 
and  engraved  it.  Natural  glasses,  such  as  obsidian,  are  rare,  but 
cryptocrystalline materials, with ﬁne crystal structures somewhat like
glass, are relatively common (e.g., ﬂint).

130 GLASS  LAYER  COUNTING

glass layer counting: a dating technique for glass based on the idea that
the  layers  present  in  the  surface  crust  of  ancient  glass  were  added 
annually  and  that  counting  them  would  yield  a  chronometric  date.
Research showed different numbers of layers on different parts of the
same piece, and for some pieces of known date, not enough layers to
suggest annual growth. Therefore, an understanding of the processes
that lead to the formation of the layers is necessary before the tech-
nique can be used with any conﬁdence.

Glastonbury  ware:  a  type  of  Middle  Iron  Age  pottery  made  in  south-
west England, mainly globular bowls, jars, and shouldered bowls with
incised decoration in curvilinear motifs.

glaze:  a  type  of  slip  applied  to  pottery  that  produces  an  impermeable
and glassy surface when ﬁred at high temperatures. It is usually pro-
duced by coating pottery with powdered glass and reheating to a tem-
perature where the glass begins to fuse. Glaze is a vitreous substance
and, like glass, is made from silica; this substance only melts at a tem-
perature higher than that which would melt the pot, so a ﬂux must
be  added  to  make  it  useable.  Silica  is  present  in  most  pottery,  so  in
these cases only the ﬂux – an oxide of sodium, lead, or potassium –
needs to be added, and a colorant if required, usually in the form of
a frit crushed and suspended in water. The pot is then ﬁred at a tem-
perature suitable for melting the glaze (somewhere between 900 and
1200°C depending on the constituents), which runs into an even layer
all over the pot. It was known in ancient Egypt where a mixture of
ﬁne sand, quartz, or crystal dust was used with an alkaline base (soda,
potash). Glaze or couverte can be identiﬁed in the Persian faiences and
Flemish stoneware. In the Hellenistic period, lead glaze was invented,
in which lead monoxide replaced soda or potash. A large variety of
glazes may be used, varying in color, texture, and suitability for dif-
ferent types of pottery. The extent, color, and ﬁnish of the glaze are
described  by  archaeologists.  The  terms  used  for  extent  are:  all-over,
areas, zones, patches, streaks, runs, dribbles, or spots. The terms used
for ﬁnish are: lustrous, glossy, dull, sparse, pitted, crazed, smooth, thick,
or thin. [glazed (adj.)]

Glevum ware: burnished wares mainly in the form of bowls, jars, and
tankards  in  a  color  range  from  creamy-buff  to  orange-red,  made  at
various  centers  along  the  Severn.  Kiln  sites  are  known  at  Malvern 
and Shepton Mallet, Somerset. It was at one time known as Glevum
ware, since it was ﬁrst recognized at Gloucester, but is now know as
Severn Valley ware. It is found all over the Severn Valley and small
quantities reached the western part of Hadrian’s Wall. [Severn Valley

globular amphora: bulbous pots with a narrow neck and perforated lugs
or small handles for suspension. Cord-impressed decoration is usual.
A  type  of  pottery  vessel  that  has  given  its  name  to  a  Late  Neolithic
or  Copper  Age  culture  of  the  3rd  millennium  bc through  much  of
Germany,  Poland,  and  western  Russia.  It  appeared  with  the  eastern
wing of the European Funnel-necked beaker culture, differentiated from
the western part. Some examples are undecorated, while others have
incised,  stamped,  or  cord-impressed  ornament  on  the  upper  part  of
the vessel. There are individual burials in stone cists under barrows,
accompanied by the globular amphora. The culture is closely linked
to the TRB culture and may be a parallel development to the Single
Grave/Corded ware group in Scandinavia of 2600–2200 bc.

globular urn: a type of Middle Bronze Age pottery in southern England,
part of the Deverel-Rimbury tradition and characterized by a ﬂat base,
expanded body, and vertical neck. They are generally made from coarse
fabrics and decoration is on the upper body and neck, typically incised
or made with impressed cord. Some have lugs or applied decoration
between the body and neck.

gloss: a type of surface treatment of pottery frequently mistaken for glaz-
ing. It involves the application of a slip to the surface, but the slip is
made of very ﬁne clay containing an unusually high proportion of the
mineral illite, which results in a glossier, shinier surface than normal
slip after ﬁring.

glossy: ﬂint with high surface sheen, usually denoting quality.
glost:  glaze  ﬁring;  the  ﬁring  process  in  which  a  glazed  ware  is  ﬁred, 
usually having already been ﬁred once (the biscuit ﬁring) before applica-
tion of the glaze. [glost ﬁre]

glyph: a carved ﬁgure, character, or picture, incised, painted, or in relief

as part of the picture writing known as hieroglyphics.

glyptics: the art of carving gems and hard stones. In the ancient East, the
term also describes the engraving of seals. [glyptic arts, sigillography]
Gnathian ware: a pottery fabric of the Hellenistic period (4th to 3rd cen-
turies bc)  in  southern  Italy.  Produced  originally  at  Apulia,  the  pots
are  decorated  with  a  black-glossed  technique  with  simple  designs  in
yellow and white. It is the western equivalent of West Slope ware. It
is unlike other south Italian pottery and was widely exported.

gold: a chemical element; a dense, lustrous, yellow precious metal with
several qualities that have made it exceptionally valuable throughout
history.  It  is  attractive  in  color  and  brightness,  durable  to  the  point
of virtual indestructibility, highly malleable, and usually found in nature
in  a  comparatively  pure  form.  It  was  one  of  the  ﬁrst  metals  to  be
exploited by man. Early working was basically by hammering, to which

Gorge

more complicated techniques like casting, soldering, granulation, and
ﬁligree were later added.

gold-ﬁgured: a Greek technique of decorating silver plate with gold foil,
especially on cups, phiale, and kantharos. Detail is incised in the gold
foil and the decoration is similar to the red-ﬁgured technique used par-
ticularly on Athenian pottery.

gold-glass: denoting a technique used to decorate Greek silver plate with
gold foil. Some of the more important examples of the technique, which
include cups, a phiale, and a kantharos, have been found at Duvanli
and  Semibratny  with  complex  ﬁgured  scenes  like  chariot  races. 
Detail  is  incised  in  the  gold  foil.  It  is  used  particular  on  Athenian 
pottery.

gorge: a bipointed object of bone (or other material) which was tied to

a ﬁshing line and caught in the ﬁsh’s mouth.

gorget: a ﬂat artifact made of stone or another material and worn as an
ornament over the chest. It may also have been a protective piece for
the throat region. These ornamental collars were common in prehis-
toric southeast and midwest US.

gorgoneion: mask of the gorgon, the mythical monster whose glance could
turn people to stone, which became a symbol to ward off evil. It was
widely used on Athenian pottery and on Roman cineraria. It was on
the center of the pediment of the temple of Artemis on Corfu.

gorytos:  a  sheath,  combining  quiver  and  bowcase,  which  was  charac-
teristic  of  the  Scythians  in  the  6th  to  3rd  centuries  bc.  Fancy  ones,
covered with golden plaques decorated with artistic relief scenes, are
known from the Scythian Kurgans of the 4th century bc, such as Solokha
and Chertomlyk. There is a depiction of a gorytos on the famous golden
Scythian vase from the Kul’-oba kurgan.

gouge: a chisel with a concave blade, used in carpentry, sculpture, and
surgery. It is a long, tapered, semicylindrical implement with a broad
groove or hollow at the U-shaped, scooplike working end.

grafﬁti: unauthorized writing or drawings on a surface in a public place;
writing  applied  to  walls  or  other  objects.  Commercial  grafﬁti  were
scratched or painted on the underside of Greek pottery. In the Roman
colony  at  Corinth,  the  public  inscriptions  were  in  Latin  and  grafﬁti
on pottery was in Greek – providing important information about the
languages.

grain: direction or texture of ﬁbers found in wood, leather, stone, or in

grain  impression:  a  cereal  grain  that  has  been  incorporated  by  chance
in an artifact, such as pottery, bricks, daub, etc. The impression left
in the clay may be clear enough for identiﬁcation to be possible and
thus  may  provide  useful  evidence  on  the  crops  in  cultivation  at  the

time. On ﬁring, or as a result of decomposition through time, the organic
material is lost but its outline remains, often in great detail. Casts of
these impressions are taken using latex rubber, and the original plant
or animal may be identiﬁed. Before the widespread sieving and ﬂota-
tion of deposits began to yield large amounts of environmental evid-
ence,  these  grain  impressions  were  an  important  method  of  getting 
information on farming practices.

granite:  a  granular  igneous  rock  composed  essentially  of  the  minerals
quartz, orthoclase feldspar, and mica. It is the most common plutonic
rock of the Earth’s crust, formed by the cooling of magma at depth.
Primarily gray in color, the crystalline rock is used mainly for build-
ing, paving, and tombstones.

granulation: a technique used in the decoration of jewelry by soldering
it with grains of gold, electrum, or silver. Tiny spherical drops of metal
were soldered on to a background, forming the required pattern and
giving it a granular texture. The drops may have been made by heat-
ing  a  gold  wire  until  a  drop  formed,  or  by  melting  gold  and  slowly
pouring it into cold water. As for ﬁligree, the solder was normally a
gold–copper alloy with a lower melting point than gold. First used as
early as the 3rd millennium bc, it was widely known in western Asia
and  Egypt.  The  ancient  Greeks  perfected  the  technique,  but  by  the 
5th century bc granulation had been largely replaced by ﬁligree in Greek
work.  The  art  of  granulation  probably  reached  its  peak  with  the
Etruscans between the 7th and 6th centuries bc, in the elaborately granu-
lated and embossed earrings, pronged shoulder clasps for clothes, and
beads found in Etruscan tombs. Granulation was particularly import-
ant in India and Persia after contact with the Roman Empire.

grape cup: a type of miniature cup or accessory vessel of Early Bronze
Age graves in southern England, with a narrow base and mouth, and
expanded bulbous body covered in small applied balls of clay that look
like a small bunch of grapes.

graphite painting: a surface treatment for pottery involving the applica-
tion  of  powdered  graphite  before  ﬁring.  As  in  hematite  coating,  the
mineral may have been applied by mixing with a slip and applied as
“paint.” The resulting surface is silvery-gray and shiny.

grappling iron: a device with hooks or claws attached to a rope and used

for dragging or grasping.

grass-marked pottery: pottery either marked or tempered with grass. In
western  Britain  there  are  examples  of  pottery  covered  with  “grass”
impressions  from  Ulster,  the  Hebrides,  and  Cornwall,  especially
around the 5th to 6th centuries ad. The term also refers to crude hand-
made  ware  made  in  various  parts  of  Frisia  in  the  Migration  period
and in certain parts of southern England in the early Saxon period in

134

GRASS-MARKED  POTTERY

which ferns and other organic material was used as tempering. [grass-
tempered pottery, grass-tempered ware]

grattoir: a ﬂaked stone scraping tool, usually ﬂint, in which the work-
ing  edge  is  at  the  end  of  the  blade  or  ﬂake  and  lies  across  its  long
axis. It is characteristic of the Upper Paleolithic and was probably used
to work wood and clean hides; from the French gratter for “scratch”
or “scrape.” [end scraper]

grave goods: valuables deposited with a corpse in a grave; the artifacts
associated  with  a  burial  or  cremation,  usually  meant  to  be  helpful 
in  the  afterlife  (such  as  jewelry,  weapons,  or  food).  They  may  also
represent personal possessions or offerings to the dead person’s spirit. 
[grave-goods]

Graveney Boat: a well-preserved Anglo-Saxon timber boat found in 1970
in the Graveney marshes in Kent, England. It is the only vessel of this
period from the British Isles which has left more than an impression
in the soil. Radiocarbon and dendrochronology have effectively dated
it to the late 9th century ad. The well-constructed Graveney Boat was
a  cross-Channel  cargo;  it  has  been  restored  and  is  in  the  National
Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England.

graver:  a  stone  tool  manufactured  from  a  ﬂake  by  chipping  (pressure
ﬂaking) it on two edges at one end so as to leave a sharp point. Gravers
were  used  to  cut  or  score  soft  materials  such  as  bone,  shell,  wood,
and  antler;  perhaps  also  for  punching  leather  and  other  purposes. 
The term also refers to a type of metalworking tool that comprises a
number  of  subtypes,  though  all  are  handheld,  hard,  and  sharp  and
are used to cut or engrave metal. Such a graver has a metal shaft that
is cut or ground diagonally downward to form a diamond-shaped point 
at the tip. The angle of the point affects the width and depth of the
engraved lines; the point is guided by thumb and foreﬁnger. [burin]
gravestone: a stone placed over or at the head or foot of a grave, or at

the entrance to a tomb.

Gravettian:  an  Upper  Paleolithic  industry  named  after  the  site  La
Gravette in the Dordogne of southwest France and characterized by
well-developed  blade  tools  of  ﬂint  and  female  ﬁgurines  of  ivory. 
This advanced industry succeeded the Aurignacian and preceded the
Solutrean, c. 28,000–20,000 bp. In France it is known as the Upper
Périgordian  (Périgordian  IV)  and  the  Gravettian  appears  to  have
developed in central Europe, expanding to the east and west. The small,
pointed blades with straight blunted backs are called Gravette points.
Most of the French sites are caves, but related industries, known as
Eastern Gravettian, are possibly distributed through the loess lands of
central Europe and Russia at the camp sites of mammoth hunters; other
sites are in Spain, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and Italy. The Gravettians

Graver

GRIDDLE

invented the bow and arrow, blunted-back knives of ﬂint, and tanged
arrowheads. They are famous, too, for their cave paintings. Other arti-
facts include bone or ivory spears and, in eastern Europe, numerous
other bone tools incised with an elaborate geometric pattern.

grayware:  1.  A  usually  undecorated  ware  of  gray  body.  [greyware] 
2. The typical household and ceremonial ceramic ware of Monte Albán
and  the  Valley  of  Oaxaca,  Mexico,  made  from  a  ﬁne  gray  paste  in
the  middle  Pre-Classic  period.  Grayware  occurs  throughout  Monte
Albán’s  occupation,  with  some  variations  in  shape  and  ornamenta-
tion. In the latter periods in the Oaxaca sequence, after the collapse
of Monte Albán, Mixtec grayware was distributed through the valley.
The Zapotecs’ merge with the Mixtecs is suggested by the correlation
between the distribution of the Mixtec ceramics in Zapotec households,
c. ad 1250–1521. [greyware]

Great interglacial: a major division of the Pleistocene epoch, the warm
interval  between  the  Mindel  and  the  Riss  glaciations  c.  400,000–
200,000 years ago.

Great Tombs period: a period in Japanese history, in the 4th to 7th cen-
tury ad, known for round tombs covered by a mound with a square
platform  off  to  the  side,  making  a  keyhole  shape.  Towards  the  end
of the period, tombs were very large and surrounded by a moat, and
earthenware ﬁgures and models (Haniwa) were placed in a series of
concentric rings around the tomb. Inside was a chamber of stone slabs,
probably adopted from the cist tomb of northeast Asia. Burial goods
included bronze mirrors, Chinese-type swords, magatama (ﬁne polished
stone ornaments), and Sue ware pottery.

Greater Peten: a major architectural style of the Classic Maya lowlands,

especially the use of polychrome painted stucco on wall surfaces.

greave: a piege of armor to protect the lower leg, especially the shin.
green: formed but unﬁred ceramic articles or their properties – as used

in the terms greenware, green strength, etc.

greenstone: a loosely applied term for a variety of metamorphosed basic
igneous  rocks  of  a  green  color:  serpentine,  olivine,  jade,  jadeite,
nephrite,  chloromelanite,  etc.  The  general  term  is  useful,  though,
since ancient people used these materials interchangeably, mainly for
high quality or ceremonial polished stone axes, ﬁgures, and other objects.
Jade was particularly popular in China and Middle America, and was
considered to have magical properties. Greenstone was important in
southeastern  Australia  and  in  New  Zealand.  The  green  color  comes
from the minerals chlorite, hornblende, or epidote.

greenware: unﬁred pottery. [greenware state]
griddle: a ﬂat ceramic plate used in the ﬁnal stage of detoxifying manioc.
After  grating  and  pulping,  thin  disks  of  manioc  are  baked  on  the 

136 GRIDDLE

griddle  into  a  kind  of  unleavened  bread.  Although  there  are  other 
methods  of  preparation,  use  of  the  griddle  is  especially  common  in
northeastern  South  American  contexts,  where  the  artifact  signiﬁes 
agricultural practice.

Grimston ware: a type of Early and Middle Neolithic pottery of north-
east  England,  characterized  by  ﬁne  fabrics,  good-quality  ﬁnish,  and
round-bottomed forms with a carinated proﬁle. [Lyles Hill ware]

grinder: a tool, machine, etc. used for grinding something.
grinding:  point  base  of  a  blade  with  the  sharp  edges  ground  off  and

smoothed.

grinding stone: any lithic (stone) artifact used to process plants for food,
medicines,  cosmetics,  or  pigments.  The  grinding  was  done  on  a  ﬂat
or concave surface. [mano]

grindstone: a revolving stone used to sharpen or polish by grinding.
grit tempering: addition of small pieces of rock or sand to the paste used

in creating a ceramic object.

grog: fragments of old or wasted pottery or ﬁrebricks that are ground
up and added to clay as ﬁller material to help reduce plasticity. Grog is
used in the manufacture of refractory products (e.g., crucibles) to reduce
shrinkage in drying and ﬁring. [ﬁller]

grog tempering: addition of small pieces of crushed ceramic to the paste

used in creating a ceramic object.

groma: a Roman surveying instrument that traced right angles. It was made
of a horizontal wooden cross pivoted at the middle and supported from
above; from the end of each of the four arms hung a plumb bob. By
sighting along each pair of plumb bob cords in turn, the right angle
could be established. The device could be adjusted to a precise right
angle by observing the same angle after turning the device approxim-
ately  90°.  By  shifting  one  of  the  cords  to  take  up  half  the  error,  a 
perfect  right  angle  would  result.  It  was  used  for  laying  out  the  grid
patterns of towns and forts, for road construction, and for centuriation.
groove-and-splinter technique: an economical method of working bone,
ivory,  or  antler  developed  during  the  Upper  Paleolithic.  Two  deep, 
parallel  grooves  were  cut  in  the  raw  material  and  the  splinter 
between  them  was  snapped  free  to  produce  a  blank  for  subsequent
reworking.

grooved: having one or more long narrow hollow spaces cut into a sur-

face, such as an ax.

grooved decoration: pottery decoration in which broad lines are drawn
on the ﬁrm but unbaked pot surface. No clay is removed, as it is in
excised  decoration,  nor  is  the  surface  itself  broken,  as  with  incised 
decoration. [grooving]

GUISARME

137

Grooved ware: a pottery style of the British Late Neolithic, widely dis-
tributed c. 2750–1850 bc. The characteristic vessel is ﬂat based with
straight vertical or outward sloping walls. It was formerly known as
Rinyo-Clacton after two widely separated ﬁndspots (Clacton in Essex
and Rinyo in the Orkney Islands). Throughout eastern and southern
England, where it is particularly frequent on henge sites (Stonehenge
and Durrington Walls), it is decorated with shallow grooving or some-
times with applied cordons. A Scottish group, where appliqué cordons
were much used in addition, is represented in Orkney at sites like Rinyo
and Skara Brae. It is also found in settlement sites and in chambered
tombs. [Rinyo-Clacton]

ground  stone  tool:  a  class  of  lithic  (stone)  artifacts  produced  by  abra-
sion – grinding or pecking – and formed into a tool or vessel. Granite,
pumice, and steatite fall into this class. Manos, metates, mortars, and
pestles are common ground stone artifacts. Ground stone tools used
to crush, pound, grind, or otherwise process materials are also com-
monly referred to as milling implements. [ground stone, ground-stone
artifact, groundstone, polished tool]

grouping: bringing together real or imaginary objects and separating them
from other groups of objects rather than on assignment to predeﬁned
classes.

guardapua:  pointed  wooden  implement,  possibly  used  in  ritual  blood-

letting.

gui: 1. In Chinese religion, a troublesome spirit that roams the world,
causing misfortune, illness, and death. They were believed to be the
spirits of individuals who were not buried properly or whose families
neglected to make proper memorial offerings. 2. A Chinese Neolithic
tripod  pottery  pitcher,  ﬁrst  made  with  solid  legs  and  then  acquiring
bulbous hollow-shaped legs, and an early Chinese bronze ritual bowl
with handles. The latter often bore writing as well as complex designs.
The  bronze  gui  was  known  in  the  Shang  period  but  was  especially
common  in  the  Western  Zhou/Chou  period.  These  items  were  used 
in protective rituals as talismans devised to ward gui away from the
family abode. [kuei]

guide ﬂake: any small ﬂakes taken from the bases of ﬂuted points prior
to the removal of channel ﬂakes and intended to guide the direction
and width of the ﬂute. [guided ﬂakes]

guilloche: a decorative chain pattern, often looking like regularly inter-
laced ribbons, reproduced on a plane surface. It has often decorated
tableware.

guisarme: a long-handled weapon that has a long blade in line with the

shaft, sharpened on both sides and ending in a point.

138 GUN

gun: a weapon incorporating a metal tube from which bullets or shells

are propelled by explosive force.

gun ﬂint: a square blade-segment of ﬂint used to ignite the powder charge
of a ﬂintlock gun; a piece of this stone, especially as ﬂaked or ground
in ancient times to form a tool or weapon; a piece of ﬂint used with
steel to produce an igniting spark. [gunﬂint]

gun  lock:  a  mechanism  by  which  the  charge  of  a  gun  is  exploded. 

[gunlock]

Gundestrup: ﬁnd spot of a great silver cauldron of the late pre-Roman
Iron Age in a bog in northern Jutland, Denmark, that was clearly a
votive  offering.  On  the  12  plaques  which  decorate  both  the  inside 
and outside of the bowl are scenes from Celtic mythology. The caul-
dron was probably manufactured in Romania or Bulgaria or possibly
Thrace during the 1st or 2nd centuries bc.

Gundlingen sword: a type of bronze sword of the Hallstatt C period in
central Europe with a long, leaf-shaped blade, broad shallow butt, and
pommel tang.

Günz  glaciation:  ﬁrst  major  Alpine  glacial  advance  and  ﬁrst  major
Pleistocene glaciation (ice age), which started c. 590,000 years ago and
lasted until the end of the Mindel glaciation. The Günz preceded the
Günz-Mindel interglacial and followed the Donau-Günz interglacial,
both periods of relatively moderate climatic conditions. The Günz is
correlated with the Baventian stage of marine deposits of Great Britain
and the Menapian glacial stage of northern Europe. It is broadly equiv-
alent to the Nebraskan glacial stage of North America.

Günz-Mindel: a major division of Pleistocene time and deposits in the
Alpine  region  of  Europe  and  one  of  the  divisions  of  the  geological 
system that recognizes the number of Pleistocene glaciations. The Günz-
Mindel interglacial preceded the Mindel glacial stage and followed the
Günz  glacial  stage  and  was  a  time  of  relatively  moderate  climatic 
conditions between two periods of glacial advance. The Günz-Mindel
interglacial is correlated with the Cromerian interglacial of northern
Europe and the series of interglacials recognized in Britain: the Pastonian
(oldest), Beestonian, and Cromerian. The Günz-Mindel interglacial is
also broadly equivalent to the Aftonian interglacial of North America.
gutturnium:  a  narrow-necked  Roman  water  jug  or  pitcher.  It  was  an 
elegant vessel, used by slaves for pouring water over the hands of guests
before and after a meal.

guttus: a narrow-necked Roman cruet or oil ﬂask, by which liquids could

be poured out drop by drop; used in sacriﬁces.

gypsum:  a  common  white  or  colorless  mineral  (hydrated  calcium  sul-
phate) used to make cements and plasters (especially plaster of Paris).

H

hacha: a thin-bladed ax thought to have had a ceremonial function for

the Maya, with a possible connection to the ball game, tlachtli.

hacksilver: fragments of ornaments and ingots in Viking silver hoards,
having  been  deliberately  cut  up  in  order  to  be  weighed  out  for  the
purpose of making payments, before the use of coins as money.

Hadra ware: a kind of Hellenistic pottery ﬁrst found in the Hadra cemet-
ery at Alexandria. It was a burial container inscribed with the name
of the deceased and often the date painted or incised on the shoulder.
haft: handle of a compound weapon or a tool – such as an adze, awl,

ax, or knife. [haft element; hafted (adj.)]

hafting:  manner  in  which  a  projectile  point  or  other  stone  tool  is

attached to a handle or shaft.

hairpin: a usually U-shaped pin for fastening the hair.
Haji:  an  unglazed  Japanese  earthenware,  developed  in  the  Tumulus/
Kofun period of the 4th century ad, derived from the Yayoi tradition
and  inﬂuenced  by  Sue  ware  shapes  in  the  5th  century.  Early  Haji 
pottery is characterized by the appearance of ceremonial vessels that
are homogenous throughout a wide area, along with domestic vessels
made in local styles. After the wheelmade, kiln-ﬁred Sue pottery was
introduced in the 5th century, only domestic vessels were made in Hajii
ware, and from the 8th century onwards Hajii pottery, too, was made
on the potter’s wheel. A rust-red earthenware, Haji ware is baked in
oxidizing ﬁres. Shapes unknown to the Yayoi culture appeared in Haji
ware,  however,  such  as  small,  globular  jars  and  wide-rimmed  pots.
Although the surfaces of Haji pieces are ﬁnely ﬁnished, both their form
and ﬁring lack the reﬁnement of Yayoi pottery. [haji]

Halaf: a large tell site on the Khabur River in northeastern Syria near
the  Turkish  border,  which  is  the  type  site  of  an  important  stage  of

140 HALAF

north Mesopotamian development, roughly from the 6th millennium
bc to the beginning of the 5th millennium (5050–4300 bc). The dis-
tinctive pottery, known as Halaf ware, was exceptionally ﬁne – a thin
hard ware in a wide range of competent and attractive shapes bear-
ing  brilliant  carpet-like  designs  painted  in  black,  red,  and  white  on
the buff surface. Simple steatite stamp seals were coming into use, which
imply the development of personal property. In the villages, the typ-
ical dwelling was a round house with a vaulted dome (tholos), con-
structed  of  mud  brick,  sometimes  on  stone  foundations.  The  Halaf
culture was succeeded in northern Mesopotamia by the Ubaid culture.
It was the seat of an Aramaean kingdom and then a provincial capi-
tal of the Neoassyrian Empire. In 808 bc, Adad-nirari III of Assyria
sacked the city and reduced the surrounding district to a province of
the  Assyrian  Empire.  The  Assyrian  archives  provide  valuable  details
of  the  administrative  affairs  of  the  time.  It  was  the  Old  Testament
“Gozan”  to  which  the  Israelites  were  deported  in  722 bc after  the 
capture of Samaria. [Guzana, Halaﬁan, Tell Halaf]

halberd: a weapon with a pointed or V-shaped blade mounted at right
angles to its haft (handle), yet with its ﬂat surface in the same plane
as the shaft, and used with a chopping motion. In bronze it was popu-
lar in the European Early Bronze Age (mainly in Ireland and central
Europe) and appears again in the Chinese Bronze Age.

halberd pendant: small hanging ornament of metal or stone modeled in

the shape of a halberd blade.

Halfan:  a  type  of  prepared  core  with  preparatory  work  like  that  of  a
Levallois core with the exception of a diagnostic series of parallel bladelet
removals from the distal end on the face of the core. The ﬁnal phase
is struck from the proximal end and displays remnants of the parallel
bladelet scars at the distal end. [Halfa]

haliotis: genus of abalone used to make beads and ornaments.
hammer: a hand tool with a heavy rigid head and a handle; used to deliver

an impulsive force by striking.

hammer-dressed: having the surface (of a stone) roughly shaped or faced

with a hammer. [hammering (n.)]

hammerhead mortarium: a mortarium with a rim and ﬂange that form
a single unit, shaped like the head of a hammer, with the center meet-
ing the body of the vessel at right angles.

hammerstone: a hard stone used as a hammer during the knapping of ﬂint
and other stone, for processing food, breaking up shells or bones, etc.
hand ax: a large bifacially worked core tool, normally oval, pointed, or
pear-shaped,  and  one  of  the  most  typical  stone  tools  of  the  Lower
Paleolithic. It is the diagnostic implement of certain Lower Paleolithic
industries (Abbevillian, Chellean, Acheulian), and one variety of the

Hammerstone

HARDNESS 141

Mousterian.  In  spite  of  the  name  it  was  not  an  ax  at  all  and  prob-
ably served as an all-purpose tool. The oldest and crudest hand axes
have been found in Africa; the ﬁner, Acheulian tools are known from
most  of  Africa,  Europe,  southwest  Asia,  and  India.  It  was  used  for
chopping,  chipping,  ﬂaking,  cutting,  digging,  and  scraping.  Hand
axes  ﬁrst  appear  between  1  and  2  million  years  ago  and  they  were
common in assemblages for about a million years. [biface, hand axe,
hand-ax, handaxe]

hand maul: a carefully manufactured unhafted stone hammer.
hand stencil: an impression of a hand produced by spraying thick paint
(often made from white clay or red or yellow ocher) through a blow-
pipe around the edges of a hand placed against a rock surface. Many
hand stencils are found in caves.

handle: an appendage attached to the exterior (sometimes interior) wall
of  a  vessel’s  body,  neck,  or  rim,  that  facilitates  the  manipulation  or
suspension of the vessel or is a decorative feature.

handstone: a handheld milling stone used to process materials on a metate.

[mano]

hanging  bowls:  thin  bronze,  shallow  bowls  found  in  Anglo-Saxon
graves up until the 7th century, an important part of a Celtic metal-
working tradition which has its origins in the Roman and pre-Roman
Iron  Age.  They  have  three  equally  spaced  suspension  rings,  ﬁxed  to
the bowl by escutcheons usually decorated with colored enamel and
milleﬁori.

haniwa:  unglazed  earthenware  funerary  sculptures  or  cylinders  of  the
Kofun period (4th to 7th centuries ad) in Japan. They were erected
on, around, or inside mounded tomb surfaces and often had repres-
entations  of  horses,  animals,  birds,  humans,  and  houses.  They  are 
considered to have developed out of the tall stands for the late Yayoi
ritual vessels of the 3rd century.

hard hammer technique: use of a hammerstone to remove ﬂakes during
knapping. Hard hammer ﬂakes are short and deep with a prominent
bulb of percussion. [hard hammer percussion]

Hardaway point: a bifacially worked, chipped stone projectile point with
a  triangular  outline,  slightly  hollow  base,  and  a  side  notch  towards
the base on either side. It may be a variation of the Dalton tradition
c. 8500–7000 bc.

hardness:  property  of  being  rigid  and  resistant  to  pressure,  not  easily
scratched,  and  measured  on  the  Mohs  scale.  In  pottery,  hardness  is
judged  as  soft  (can  be  scratched  with  a  ﬁngernail),  hard  (cannot  be
scratched  with  a  ﬁngernail),  or  very  hard  (cannot  be  scratched  with
a  knife);  for  archaeology,  pottery  hardness  is  most  commonly  mea-
sured by the Mohs scale.

142 HARD-PASTE

hard-paste: denoting true porcelain made of fusible and infusible mater-
ials  (usually  kaolin  and  china  stone)  ﬁred  at  a  high  temperature.
Developed in early medieval China, it was not made in Europe until
the early 18th century. [true porcelain]

harness: arrangement of straps used to control an animal and/or to attach

the animal to a vehicle.

harpoon:  a  spear-like  missile  with  a  detachable  head,  often  consisting
of a pointed shaft with backward-pointing barbs. It was often loosely
hafted so that it would separate from its shaft after the point had struck
its target. The appearance of this weapon is associated in particular
with the Magdalenian culture, was particularly popular during the Upper
Paleolithic  and  Mesolithic,  and  was  used  for  hunting  or  ﬁshing.  An
attached line was used to retrieve the catch. Some anthropologists refer
to all barbed bone or antler points as harpoons.

Harpoons

harpoon head: arming tip of a harpoon. They are generally classiﬁable
into two main forms – toggling and barbed – each of which may be
composite or single piece, and may or may not carry additional cut-
ting blades or side blades. They always have line-guards or other means
of line attachment. [harpoon point]

harrow: a frame set with teeth used to drag over plowed ﬁelds to break

hasp: a hinged or looped clasp that ﬁts over a staple and is secured by

down the earth clods, etc.

a pin, bolt, or padlock.

hasta: a spear or shaft used for thrusting, or as a missile for hurling from
the hand, or as a bolt from an engine. The shaft of the spear is called
the hastile.

hatchet: a small, handled ax.
heat  treating:  process  of  baking  a  ﬂint  or  chert  nodule  at  a  high  tem-
perature (175–260°C) for 30–50 hours in order to increase the work-
ability  of  the  stone;  an  aboriginal  process  by  which  the  ﬂaking
properties  of  a  rock  were  improved  by  controlled  heating  in  a  ﬁre.
[heat treatment]

heddle loom: a specialized loom that lifts some of the warp (lengthwise)
threads so that the weft (crosswise) threads can be passed through the
warp easily and quickly. The heddles are short lengths of wire or ﬂat
steel  strips  used  to  deﬂect  the  warp  to  either  side  of  the  main  sheet
of  fabric.  Originally  heddles  were  movable  rods,  but  later  cords,

HELMET

143

wires,  or  steel  bands  were  used.  They  are  supported  by  the  loom’s
harness, and each has an eyelet through which the warp threads pass.
The heddle is considered to be the most important single advance in
the evolution of looms in general. [heald loom]

hei  tiki:  a  Maori  neck  pendant,  often  of  greenstone,  in  the  shape  of  a

human.

Hell  Gap:  a  Plano  tradition  complex  of  the  Paleoindian  period  from 
c. 11,200 to 8000 bc (the complex dates to c. 10,000–9500 bp) and
centered on a well-preserved, deeply stratiﬁed site in eastern Wyoming.
Hell  Gap  is  also  the  name  of  a  projectile  point  type  of  the  Plano 
tradition, which is bifacially worked with a broad pointed top set on
a  straight-sided  trapezoidal  body.  The  base  is  narrow  and  straight.
Experiments show that these points were probably spearheads and fully
capable  of  penetrating  the  hide  and  ribcage  of  large  beasts  such  as
bison. [Hell Gap point]

Helladic: Bronze Age culture of central and southern mainland Greece,
with three main divisions: Early (c. 3000–2000 bc), Middle (c. 2000–
1550 bc), and Late (c. 1550–1050 bc). It is equivalent to Cycladic in
the Cyclades and Minoan in Crete; late Helladic is equated with the
period  of  the  Mycenaean  civilization.  Each  of  the  three  periods  is 
subdivided into three phases designated by Roman numerals.

Hellenistic period: period of the widest Greek inﬂuence, the era between
the death of Alexander the Great (323 bc) and the rise of the Roman
Empire  (27/30 bc),  when  a  single,  uniform  civilization,  based  on 
Greek traditions, prevailed all over the ancient world, from India in
the  east,  to  Spain  in  the  west.  During  these  three  centuries,  Greek 
culture  crossed  many  political  frontiers  and  spread  through  many 
cities founded at that time, especially the new capitals of Alexandria,
Antioch,  and  Pergamum.  A  common  civilization  became  established
throughout the known world for the ﬁrst time, one which integrated
the cultural heritage of each region and subsequently left a deep impres-
sion  on  the  institutions,  thought,  religions,  and  art  of  the  Roman,
Parthian, and Kushan Empires. The Hellenistic cultural inﬂuence con-
tinued  to  be  a  powerful  force  in  the  Roman  and  Parthian  Empires 
during the early centuries ad.

helmet: protective headgear that goes back almost as far as evidence for
warfare. The basic function was to protect the head, face, and some-
times the neck from the cutting blows of swords, spears, arrows, and
other weapons. The Assyrians and Persians had helmets of leather and
iron, and the Greeks created bronze helmets, some of which covered
the  entire  head,  with  only  a  narrow  opening  in  the  front  for  vision
and  breathing.  The  Romans  developed  several  forms  of  helmets,
including  the  round  legionary’s  helmet  and  the  special  gladiator’s 

Hell Gap point

(Paleo)

144 HELMET

helmet, with a broad brim and pierced visor, giving exceptional pro-
tection to the head, face, and neck. The troops on the Royal Standard
of Ur wore leather helmets. The Blue Crown worn by the pharaoh in
the New Kingdom of Egypt was a war helmet. One type covered with
boars’ tusks was current among the Mycenaeans. More obviously for
parade  than  war  are  the  bronze  examples  from  the  European  Late
Bronze  Age  and  Iron  Age.  Among  the  Villanovans  the  cinerary  urn
was  often  covered  with  the  helmet  of  the  dead  warrior.  Several  ﬁne
examples from Britain are decorated with Celtic art. The New World
has  yielded  helmets  made  of  gold  and  of  wood  encrusted  with
turquoise mosaic. The term “helm” was applied by both Saxons and
Normans, in the 11th century, to a conical steel cap with a noseguard,
the common headpiece of the day. Helmet is a diminutive of helm.

hematite: a heavy, deep red iron oxide commonly used by the Indians
as decorative body paint and for pictographs. Steel-gray crystals and
coarse-grained varieties are known as specular iron ore; thin scaly types
are called micaceous hematite. Much hematite occurs in a soft, ﬁne-
grained, earthy form called red ocher or ruddle. Red ocher is used as
a paint pigment; a puriﬁed form, rouge, is used to polish plate glass.
The most important deposits of hematite are sedimentary in origin and
the largest deposit is in the Lake Superior district in North America.
[bloodstone, haematite, red hematite, red iron ore, red ocher, rhom-
bohedral iron ore]

hematite coating: a surface treatment for pottery involving the applica-
tion of powdered hematite iron ore before ﬁring. Hematite may have
been mixed with a slip and then applied, or painted on as a suspen-
sion in water. When ﬁred the surface normally appears red, although
under reduced ﬁring conditions it may turn black. [haematite coating]
Hembury ware: a type of plain Early and Middle Neolithic pottery found
in southwestern England in the 4th millennium bc, characterized by
round-bottomed vessels with straight sides or S-proﬁled bodies.

Hemigkofen  sword:  a  type  of  bronze  sword  with  a  leaf-shaped  blade
and ﬂanged hilt found in central Europe during the Hallstatt A period
and traded to other parts of northern Europe.

Hengelo  interstadial:  a  continental  Middle  Pleniglacial  interstadial  of 
the  Weichselian  cold  stage,  starting  around  39,000 bp.  It  occurred 
during  the  ﬁnal  glaciation  between  the  Moershooft  and  Denekamp 
interstadials.

herm: a statue in the form of a square stone pillar topped by a bust or

head, especially of Hermes.

Hertzian  cone  of  force:  the  cone  shape  in  which  the  energy  of  a  pro-
jectile impact in high-silica-content stone radiates through the struc-
ture of the stone. [Hertzian cone]

hide: dressed skin of an animal (especially a large animal).

HOARD

145

hide scraper:  a  tool  made  out  of  bone  or  stone  used  for  removing  the

ﬂesh from an animal hide.

hieroglyphic:  ancient  writing  form  with  pictographic  or  ideographic

symbols – used in Egypt, Mesopotamia, etc.

hinge: a joint that holds two parts together so that one can swing rela-
tive to the other; a natural joint that performs a similar function, for
example that of a bivalve shell.

hinge fracture: a feature of a struck ﬂint ﬂake that occurs either through
an error in striking technique or because of the conchoidal nature of
a particular piece of ﬂint. Instead of coming to a sharp, thin end, the
struck ﬂake ends in a rounded, smooth, turned-out edge.

hinge termination: a fracture at the distal end of a lithic ﬂake somewhat
like a step termination, but more curvilinear in cross-section, indicat-
ing  that  the  shockwave  of  ﬂake  removal  curved  outwards  from  the
core, toward the distal side of the ﬂake. [hinged (adj.)]

hippo sandal: a type of iron shoe for draft animals during Roman times
in Britain, for protection of their hooves and to aid in wet conditions.
Hispano-Moresque  pottery:  a  tin-glazed,  lustrous,  highly  decorated
earthenware  made  by  Moorish  potters  in  Spain  in  the  late  medieval
period,  chieﬂy  at  Málaga  in  the  15th  century,  and  in  the  region  of
Manises, near Valencia, in the 16th century. The pottery tends to be
plates and jugs with bold, semiabstract designs painted on a creamy
background and with a gold luster ﬁnish. These wares were much in
demand  throughout  Europe  and,  judging  from  ﬁnds  in  northern
Europe,  they  were  widely  traded.  The  tin  glaze  was  applied  over  a
design usually traced in cobalt blue; after the ﬁrst ﬁring, the luster, a
metallic pigment, was applied by brush over the tin glaze, and the piece
was ﬁred again. Imitation of this pottery in Italy led to the develop-
ment of Italian majolica ware.

historic  period:  any  period  of  the  past  that  can  be  studied  from  its 

written documents.

hoard: any collection of objects buried at one time; a deliberate deposit
of complete and/or broken objects buried in the ground for subsequent
recovery  or  as  a  symbolic  act.  A  hoard  often  includes  valuables  or
prized  possessions.  Many  hoards  represent  the  personal  property  of
individuals,  buried  for  safety  at  a  time  of  threat  and  not  recovered.
Hoards are a useful source of evidence for archaeologists, because they
provide  considerable  quantities  of  material  and,  except  in  the  case 
of  some  votive  hoards,  that  material  represents  a  true  association.
Various classes are distinguished according to their method of accu-
mulation. A merchant’s hoard will contain new objects ready for sale.
A founder’s hoard by contrast will contain obsolete, worn out, or mis-
cast  objects,  and  frequently  cake  metal  as  well  –  all  of  it  awaiting 
melting down and recasting. A votive hoard is rather different in that

Hoe

146 HOARD

the  objects  were  deposited,  possibly  over  a  long  period  of  time,  in 
temples or caves, buried, or thrown into water as religious offerings,
with no intention of recovery. A hoard of loot is self-explanatory. Bronze
Age hoards provide much of the evidence for the period.

hobnail:  a  metal  stud  hammered  into  the  sole  of  footwear  to  provide

grip. [hob nail]

hoe: one of the oldest tools of agriculture, a digging implement consisting
of a blade set at right angles to a long handle (haft). Early hoes had
stone or wooden blades. Examples made from antler go back to the
Mesolithic. Most early hoes were used by the farming peoples of the
Neolithic. Hoes succeeded the digging stick and gave rise to the plow.
The digging stick, the precursor of most agricultural hand tools, was
simply a sharpened branch sometimes weighted with a stone. [mattock]
Hofheim-type ﬂagon: a single or double-handled ﬂagon with a cylindrical
neck and outcurved rim, triangular in section, c. mid 1st century ad,
from Hofheim, Germany.

hog-backed grave cover: type of stones used to cover graves during the
10th  century  ad in  northern  England  and  southern  Scotland  –  rect-
angular blocks with ﬂat bottoms and pitched tops usually decorated
with interlaced designs.

hokei shukobo: burial precincts of the Yayoi and Kufun periods of Japan.
There are cofﬁn and pit burials of adults and jar burials of children.
holdfast: a metal fastener used to hold a tile or stone against a spacer
and driven into a wall, thus forming a ﬂue between the wall and the
tile or stone; also used to hold timber together.

hollow ware: cups, jugs, bowls, etc. and serving dishes and accessories,
especially of silver, that are hollow or concave; hollow articles of cook-
ware or crockery.

hollow scraper: a blade or ﬂake tool with a notch in the side or the end

showing signs of being worked.

Holocene: present geological epoch, which began some 10,000 (bp) years
ago (8300 bc). It falls within the Quaternary period (one of the four
main divisions of the Earth’s history) and followed the Pleistocene Ice
Age. The Holocene is marked by rising temperatures throughout the
world and the retreat of the ice sheets. During this epoch, agriculture
became  the  most  common  human  subsistence  practice.  During  the
Holocene, Homo sapiens diversiﬁed his tool technology, organized his
habitat  more  efﬁciently,  and  adapted  his  way  of  life.  The  Holocene
stage/series  includes  all  deposits  younger  than  the  top  of  either  the
Wisconsinian stage of the Pleistocene series in North America or the
Würm/Weichsel in Europe.

Holstein:  north  European  Middle  Pleistocene  warm  phase  occur-
ring  between  the  Elsterian  and  Saalian  cold  stages,  c.  300,000–
200,000 bp. These deposits are stratiﬁed above the Elster glacial deposits

HORNS  OF  CONSECRATION

and are overlain by the Saale glacial deposits. The Alpine equivalent
is the Mindel-Riss and the North American equivalent is the Yarmouth.
In Britain, it was the Hoxnian.

Holt  ware:  a  pottery  made  at  Holt,  Denbighshire,  England  in  the  late

1st and early 2nd centuries ad of light-red and buff fabric.

hook and eye: a small metal hook and loop used together as a fastener

on a garment.

Hopewell point: distinctive broad-bladed points of an agricultural sub-
culture  of  the  Woodland  stage,  with  complex  settling  in  Ohio  and
Illinois, around 100 bc and lasting to ad 500.

hopper mortar: a mortar whose sides are formed by a bottomless basket

attached to the stone.

horizon: 1. Any artifact, art style, or other cultural trait that has exten-
sive geographic distribution but a limited time span. The term in anthro-
pology refers to the spread of certain levels of cultural development.
The main meaning, however, refers to a phase, characterized by a par-
ticular artifact or artistic style that is introduced to a wide area and
which  may  cross  cultural  boundaries.  Provided  that  these  “horizon 
markers” were diffused rapidly and remained in use for only a short
time, the local regional cultures in which they occur will be roughly
contemporary.  A  horizon  can  also  be  deﬁned  as  a  primarily  spatial
continuity represented by one or more cultural traits whose nature and
mode of occurrence permit the assumption of a broad and rapid spread.
In  the  Andes,  the  sequence  of  the  horizons  was:  Preceramic,  Early
Horizon, Early Intermediate, Middle Horizon, Late Intermediate, and
Late Horizon. In Mesoamerica, the sequence was: Formative, Classic,
and Post-Classic. [horizon style] 2. In geology, horizons are the layers
of  natural  features  in  a  region;  in  soil  science,  a  horizon  is  a  layer
formed in a soil proﬁle by soil-forming processes.

horizontal loom: a structure for weaving fabric made of a frame set hor-
izontally  across  vertical  supports.  The  warp  threads  are  tied  across
the frame from front to back so that they can be wound out as weav-
ing proceeds. The warp is usually arranged so that alternate threads
can be raised and lowered, thus allowing the weaver to pass a shuttle
containing the weft thread from side to side across the warp.

horizontal-transverse  ﬂaking:  a  unique  ﬂaking  style  where  horizontal 
parallel  ﬂakes  are  removed  that  extend  from  one  edge  of  the  blade,
across to the other edge.

horn: one of a pair of bony processes that grow from the head of many
hoofed mammals. They are usually permanent hollow sheaths of keratin
present in both sexes of cattle and their relatives. Antlers are also horns.
horns of consecration: a religious symbol of the Minoans, especially at
the palace of Knossos, etc., made of alabaster or other stone and based
on the horns of a sacriﬁced bull. [sacral horns]

148 HORSE  BIT

horse bit: a metal mouthpiece on a bridle, used to control a horse.
horsehoof core: a steep-edged, often large, domed core with ﬂat-based
striking platforms, heavily step-ﬂanked around their margins. Both very
large  and  smaller  varieties  are  found  commonly  on  Pleistocene  sites
in most areas of Australia and on some mid-Holocene sites; they are
considered characteristic of the Australian Core Tool and Scraper tra-
dition. They were chopping tools mainly used in woodworking. The
step-ﬂaking could have resulted from repeated striking to remove ﬂakes.
horseshoe:  a  covering  for  the  base  of  a  horse’s  foot  consisting  of  a 

narrow band of iron in the form of an extended circular arc.

hourglass perforation: a type of perforation found in many prehistoric
stone  artifacts  in  which  holes  are  drilled  from  opposite  sides  of  the
artifact. The perforation tends to be biconical or hourglass in form.
[hour-glass perforation]

household  cluster:  a  term  used  to  describe  a  set  of  features  associated
with one house structure. Components would include a house, a few
storage pits, some graves, a rubbish area, perhaps an oven or hearth,
and activity areas. It is an arbitrary archaeological unit deﬁning arti-
fact  patterns  reﬂecting  the  activities  that  take  place  around  a  house
and assumed to belong to one household. [household unit]

Hoxnian:  an  interglacial  stage  of  Great  Britain  that  is  correlated  with
the Needian interglacial of the Netherlands, the Holstein interglacial
of  northern  Europe,  the  Mindel-Riss  interglacial  of  Classical  Alpine
Europe, and is also considered to be approximately contemporaneous
with  the  Yarmouth  interglacial  of  North  America.  It  is  named  after
the site of Hoxne where deposits are older than the extreme range of
radiocarbon dating (70,000 bp). Some Hoxnian deposits are stratiﬁed
above  Anglian  glacial  deposits,  others  below  Wolstonian  glacial
deposits.  Acheulian  and  Clactonian  artifacts  are  found  in  Hoxnian
deposits.  In  addition,  parts  of  hominid  skulls  have  been  found  in
Hoxnian gravels at Swanscombe.

huaca:  a  South  American  term  for  places  that  the  Inca  believed  to  be
sacred and to have magical powers. Derived from the Quechua word
for shrine, a huaca can be a rock or cave or even an amulet.

Huai style: a type of bronze decoration used in the 6th to 3rd centuries
bc by  the  Eastern  Zhou/Chou.  Cast  in  relief,  the  decoration  was  a
dense array of hooks and curls. The style is found by and named for
the  Huai  River.  In  its  early  manifestations,  the  Huai  style  might  be
viewed  as  a  Yangzi  region  counterpart  to  the  Liyu  designs  of  north
China. The most outstanding Huai-style designs, including extraordin-
ary examples from Sui Xian, belong to the 5th century. This term is
sometimes  used  for  a  period  style  applicable  to  the  whole  of  China
for the years around 650–200 bc.

huang:  a  ﬂat,  semicircular  or  arc-shaped  jade  pendant  known  from

Neolithic sites in China and made throughout the Bronze Age.

Huang-tao  ware:  a  type  of  Chinese  stoneware  made  in  the  T’ang
dynasty (618–907 ad) in the Honan province. It is glazed in black or
brown and splashed with an opalescent bluish or gray contrasting glaze.
hue:  ﬁrst  quality  of  a  color  corresponding  to  its  perception  as  visible
light  as  red,  blue,  green,  etc.  In  Munsell  nomenclature,  hue  refers 
to  different  pages  or  sheets  corresponding  to  the  radii  of  the  color 
cylinder model.

Humbolt series point: bifacially worked chipped stone points of lance-
olate outline, hollow base, and no side notches, manufactured in the
Archaic stage of the Great Plains and western North America in the
period c. 3000 bc to ad 700.

hunt cup: a style of Roman color-coated beaker with a decorative hunt-

ing scene in barbotine.

Huntcliff ware: a variety of calcite-gritted pottery made in east Yorkshire
from the 1st century ad through to the 4th century ad. It is black or
dark brown and handmade.

hydration rim: a surface layer on obsidian artifacts that can be measured

as a dating technique.

hydria:  a  form  of  Greek  water  pot;  a  large  jar  or  pitcher  for  carrying
water with two or three handles. The body was bulbous, the neck round.
It was wider and usually lower than the amphora and it had a well-
deﬁned foot and neck. There were two horizontal loop handles on the
body for carrying and one vertical handle from the rim to the shoulder
for pouring.

hydroceramic: designating porous, unglazed pottery in which liquids were

cooled or ﬁltered. [hydro-ceramic]

hygroscopic:  ability  or  tendency  of  a  material  to  take  up  moisture 

readily from the surrounding air or other most materials.

Hypsithermal: a Holocene climatic optimum in the eastern woodlands of
North America, equivalent to the Altithermal segment of the Holocene
epoch (the Holocene runs from 10,000 years ago to the present), dated
on the basis of pollen studies. The Hypsithermal climatic interval began
about 9000 years ago and ended about 2500 years ago. It has been
divided into smaller units beginning with the Boreal. The Hypsithermal
follows the Pre-Boreal and precedes the Sub-Atlantic intervals. It was
a  time  of  comparatively  warm  climatic  conditions  which  resulted  in
the elimination of many cooler plant and animal refuges and the extinc-
tion  of  some  species.  In  many  parts  of  the  world,  pine  forests  gave
way to forests dominated by oak during the Hypsithermal. Mesolithic
and Neolithic cultures are contemporaneous with Hypsithermal events
in both the New and Old Worlds.

I

ice age: a period of intense cold and the expansion of glaciers, resulting
in  a  lower  sea  level.  Such  periods  of  large-scale  glaciation  may  last
several million years and drastically reshape surface features of entire
continents. In the past, there were many ice ages; the earliest known
took place during Precambrian time dating back more than 570 mil-
lion years. The most recent periods of widespread glaciation occurred
during the Pleistocene epoch (1,600,000–10,000 years ago). A lesser,
recent glacial stage called the Little Ice Age began in the 16th century
and  advanced  and  receded  intermittently  over  three  centuries.  Its
maximum  development  was  reached  about  1750,  at  which  time
glaciers  were  more  widespread  on  Earth  than  at  any  time  since  the
principal  Quaternary  ice  ages.  The  idea  of  an  ice  age  in  the  geolo-
gical  sequence  is  usually  credited  to  Jean  Louis  Agassiz,  a  Swiss 
naturalist, who suggested it c. 1837. Agassiz conceived a worldwide
cold period when areas as far apart as North America and Germany
had been glaciated.

icon: a single image created as a focal point of religious veneration, espe-
cially  a  painted  or  carved,  portable  object  of  the  eastern  Orthodox
faith, which spread through the Christian world from the mid 6th cen-
tury ad onwards, though little survives from before the 10th century.
They are a central component of the material culture of the Orthodox
church.

ideofact: archaeological material resulting from past human ideological
activities;  any  object  whose  function  is  to  express  or  symbolize  the
beliefs of a people rather than to serve practical or social needs.

ideofunction: use of an object for ideological purposes; for example, the
wearing of a special garment as part of a religious ceremony. [ideo-
functional (adj.)]

IMPASTO

151

ideotechnic: properties of an artifact that deﬁnitively reﬂect the mental,

cognitive component of culture.

igneous  rock:  a  rock  that  originated  as  molten  magma  from  beneath 
the Earth’s surface and subsequently came to the surface as an extru-
sion,  or  remained  below  ground  as  an  intrusion.  The  nature  of  the
rock  depends  in  part  on  the  rate  at  which  it  cooled;  as  intrusions 
of  magma  slowly  solidify,  enough  time  elapses  for  large  crystals  to
form  whereas  extrusions  cool  quickly,  leaving  little  time  for  crystal
growth.  Thus,  a  coarse-grained,  intrusive  igneous  rock  has  a  ﬁne-
grained, extrusive counterpart – granite is coarse rhyolite and gabbro
is  coarse  basalt.  Igneous  rocks  are  also  classiﬁed  as  acid  or  basic, 
according to whether their silica content is high (e.g., granite) or low
(e.g., basalt).

Illinoian: a glacial stage of the Quaternary in North America, followed
by  the  Sangamon  interglacial  and  following  the  Yarmouth.  The
Illinoian ice sheet covered a small area of southeastern and extreme
eastern  Iowa,  and  in  so  doing  it  diverted  the  Mississippi  River  and
created a valley along its western front that can still be seen. It con-
sists mainly of tills, the products of large ice sheets, and has been split
up into three substages: the Liman, Monican, and Jubileean. It is unclear
how many cold stages the Illinoian deposits represent, but it may be
more  than  one.  The  Illinoian  glacial  stage  ended  with  a  cool,  moist
period  that  gradually  became  drier  and  then  warmer.  The  Illinoian
has never been dated satisfactorily but it is roughly contemporary with
the Riss and Saale glacial periods.

illite: a group of clay minerals having a three-layer, nonexpanding struc-

ture similar to that of well-crystallized micas.

imbrex: a Latin term used to describe a semicylindrical tile used to cover
the ﬂanges of two adjoining tegulae; a roof-ridge tile, semicircular in
cross-section.

imbrication: covering with a design in which one element covers a part

of another (as with tiles or shingles). [imbrix]

impact fracture: a breakage of the distal tip of a projectile which is char-
acterized by a missing portion of the tip and an elongate fracture scar
extending along one face of the blade. It usually occurred during impact
when a point was thrown or shot.

impasto: 1. A type of early pottery of Etruria, made from unreﬁned clay
and ﬁred to a dark brown or black, especially during the Villanovan
period. Some pieces were biconical urns and hut models and were used
for cremations. 2. A paint that is applied to a canvas or panel in quan-
tities that make it stand out from the surface. It was used frequently
to mimic the broken-textured quality of highlights – i.e., the surfaces
of objects that are struck by an intense light.

IMPRESSED  WARE

Impressed ware: earliest Neolithic pottery of the Mediterranean area, with
decoration  impressed  into  the  clay  by  sticks,  combs,  ﬁngernails,  or
seashells, from before 6000 bc to around 4000 bc (though until later
in North Africa). The pottery itself was characterized as having sim-
ple,  round-bottomed  shapes.  The  serrated  edge  of  the  cardium  shell
was  particularly  popular  in  the  western  area,  giving  the  alternative 
name of Cardial ware. Before c. 5000 bc the ware is found mainly in
caves or rock shelters or shell midden sites, where it was associated
with hunting-gathering and the breeding of sheep. Around 5000 bc,
crop cultivation was introduced and large settled villages sprang up.
Other types of pottery are found alongside Impressed ware at this stage,
including ﬁne red-painted ware in Italy, Stentinello ware in Sicily, and
Ghar  Dalam  ware  in  Malta,  which  represent  specialized  versions  of
Impressed ware. The pottery style may have originated in Asia Minor
or even Yugoslavia (Starcevo culture).

impressing: a type of pottery decoration produced by pressing something
into  the  surface  of  the  clay  when  still  soft.  Stamped  decoration  is  a
special form of this, in which a stick or bone is previously carved to
give the impression its design. Intermediate in form are the impressions
of natural objects like bird bones or serrated seashells. There are a num-
ber of cultures that made pottery with impressed designs. [impressed
decoration, impressed ﬁnger-tipping, impression; impressed (adj.)]

in situ: in the normal or natural or original position or place – describ-
ing an artifact encountered during excavation or survey. From the Latin
for “in its original place.”

incense burner: any container, often of bronze or pottery and ﬁtted with
a perforated lid, in which incense is burnt. The burning of incense as
part of ritual life was a widespread practice in Mesoamerica, from as
early as the Pre-Classic period, as well as in Europe and the East. In
Mesoamerica  there  is  considerable  variety  in  form,  from  the  simple
small candelero (Teotihuacan) to the highly elaborate incensarios of
Palenque  and  Mayapan.  Copal,  the  Maya  word  for  pine  resin,  was
widely  traded  as  incense;  it  appears  in  the  Aztec  tribute  lists  in  the
Codex  Mendoza.  In  China  during  the  Han  dynasty  (206 bc to
ad 220),  a  type  of  vessel  known  as  a  hill  censer  was  used.  Incense
burners  of  the  Ming  dynasty  (1368–1644)  were  made  in  two  basic
forms: a square vessel on four feet, ﬁtted with two handles and a pierced
lid, and a circular tripod vessel, also ﬁtted with a perforated lid.

incense  cup:  a  small  subsidiary  vessel  found  with  Middle  Bronze  Age
burials  and  placed  beside  food  vessels  or  urns  in  southern  England.
It  is  found  with  the  skeleton  or  cinerary  urn  in  the  barrows  of  the
Wessex culture, c. 1700 bc. The name is an archaeological label only,
arising from the holes some of these vessels have through their walls,
as their use is actually unknown. [pygmy vessel]

INDUSTRY

153

incise: to make a cut or cuts in a surface; to cut (a mark or decoration)

incised  slate:  a  ﬂat,  unshaped  stone  tablet  containing  motifs  inscribed

into a surface. [incised (adj.)]

by a human hand.

incising: a technique for decorating ceramics that involves cutting linear

designs into the surface of an object. [engraving]

incision: a ﬁnishing technique in ceramics manufacture whereby a nar-
row tool cuts into the surface, displacing material to either side and
drags  along  to  deposit  more  material  toward  the  end  of  a  linear  or
curvilinear trough or valley. [incised decoration; incised (adj.)]

inclusion:  material  added  to  clay  to  provide  strength  and  improve  the
ﬁring  process.  Inclusions  can  be  very  ﬁne,  ﬁne,  medium,  coarse,  or
very coarse. The main inclusion types are: organic, ﬂint, grog, shell,
ironstone, limestone, mica, sand (quartz/quartzite), volcanic/igneous,
or unknown. [temper]

incrusting: impressing of material into the surface of a ceramic object.
incurvate: a term to describe an outline or shape that is indented or con-

vex; it is a form of the basal edge or stem base outline.

indented: pertaining to the sides of a vessel that have been pushed in a
regular  sequence  to  form  oval  concavities.  [dimpled,  folded,  thumb-
indented]

index  fossil:  a  fossil  with  widespread  geographic  range  but  which  is
restricted  in  time  to  a  brief  existence.  In  archaeology,  it  is  a  theory
that proposes that strata containing similar fossil assemblages will tend
to be of similar age. This concept enables archaeologists to characterize
and date strata within archaeological sites using diagnostic artifact forms,
making an animal species the basis for dating by faunal association.
Artifacts that share the attributes of index fossils are useful in the cross-
dating and correlation of deposits that contain them and in the con-
struction of chronologies. [index fossil concept, index species]

indigenous remains: artifacts or ecofacts that were created only shortly

before the deposit in which they were found. [indigenous ﬁnds]

indirect percussion: a technique of stone-tool manufacture in
which  ﬂakes  are  removed  from  a  ﬂint  core  in  a  way  that
causes less wasteful shatter of the material than direct per-
cussion. The hammer or hammerstone does not strike the
ﬂint but rather a wood, antler, or bone punch, usually with
a prepared edge, so that the manufacture of ﬂakes is more
controlled. [indirect ﬂaking]

industry: 1. A frequently repeated assemblage of a particular
material  or  function,  e.g.,  ﬂake  industry,  ﬂint  industry.
Such  an  assemblage  of  artifacts  including  the  same  types
so consistently suggests that it is the product of a single soci-
ety.  2.  A  large  grouping  of  artifacts  that  is  considered  to

represent or identify a particular people or culture, e.g., the Acheulian
industry. If more than one class of objects (e.g., ﬂint tools or bronze
weapons) is found, it is a “culture.”

inﬁltrated remains: artifacts or ecofacts that were created after the de-
posit in which they were found, but worked their way into it without
necessarily leaving any obvious trace of their inﬁltration. [inﬁltrated ﬁnds]
infusible clay: clay that is not fusible and not capable of being dissolved

or melted.

ingot: a shaped or cast mass of unwrought metal resulting from smelt-
ing or other extraction process. Ingots are often of a standard weight,
and sometimes of a guaranteed purity. Examples include the ingot of
the Mycenaeans (c. 30 kg (65 pounds) of copper) in the shape of an
ox hide, the bronze ingot torc of the European Bronze Age, the iron
currency bar of the English Iron Age, and the Roman lead pig stamped
with the smelter’s name.

Initial Period: the period of 1800–900 bc marking the introduction of
pottery in Andean South America. It was also the time when agricul-
ture and animal husbandry began to be the subsistence base for most
cultures in the area. It is one of a seven-period chronological construction
used  in  Peruvian  archaeology.  Its  close  is  marked  by  the  occurrence
of Chavín materials and the abandonment of many of the coastal cen-
ters. Many of the traits that make up the Peruvian cultural tradition
– such as intensive agriculture, the widespread use of textiles, monu-
mental ceremonial architecture, and larger and more numerous pop-
ulation centers – occurred during this period.

inlay: placement of one material, either glass or metal, into a prepared
depression (reservoir) on the surface of an item for decorative purposes.
inorganic material: material that is neither animal nor plant; inanimate,

or artiﬁcial material.

inscribed: pertaining to marks or lines forming a design, motif, image,
or  pattern  of  some  kind  that  has  been  cut  into  stone,  metal,  bone,
wood, ceramic, or other fairly soft material.

inscription: something that is inscribed; the act of inscribing. It is writ-
ing or any type cut into or raised upon a hard surface – clay, wood,
stone, metal, etc. – and therefore endures. Inscriptions on coins, medals,
seals,  currency  notes,  etc.,  may  be  done  with  symbolic  picture  writ-
ing, abbreviations, or phonetic alphabets.

intaglio:  a  gemstone  into  whose  surface  a  decoration  is  cut;  this  tech-
nique  of  decoration.  This  prehistoric  incised  carving  was  also  done
on  precious  metal.  The  design  was  especially  used  on  seal  stones, 
which were sometimes set into rings and used as personal seals. The
engraved subject is sunk beneath the surface, thus distinguishing it from
a cameo, which is engraved in relief.

INTERSTADIAL

155

Integration  period:  last  stage  of  Ecuadorian  prehistory,  from  about
ad 500 to the Inca conquest (ad 1550), characterized by greater cultural
uniformity over wider areas. There is evidence for urban centers, class
distinction, intensive agriculture, and high-quality metallurgy through-
out the region. The absorption of Ecuador into the Inca Empire was
the culmination of this trend. It is part of the chronological continuum
–  the  Formative,  Regional  Development,  and  Integration  periods  – 
formulated by Betty Meggers.

intercalation:  act  or  instance  of  inserting  extra  time  such  as  days,

months, and the like, into the calendar.

Intercultural style: a style of decoration of stone vessels, normally made
of chlorite, found in Iran, Mesopotamia, and the Persian Gulf in the
second half of the 3rd millennium bc. Vessels and other objects made
of  chlorite,  steatite,  serpentine,  and  other  soft  stones,  shared  a  rich
iconography.  A  production  center  was  discovered  at  Tepe  Yahya.
[Intercultural style carved chlorite]

interglacial: a warm period between two glaciations with little or no glacial
ice,  and  with  warm  climate  processes,  deposits,  ﬂora  and  fauna, 
and increased soil formation. The ice sheets diminish in area, and the 
improved climate allows the growth of temperate types of vegetation. The
last 10,000 years (the Holocene) is probably an interglacial. During the
Quaternary, interglacials have been considerably shorter than glacials.
interior ﬂake: a ﬂake having no cortex. [noncortical ﬂake, tertiary ﬂake]
interlace:  a  pattern  of  ornamentation  that  consists  of  twisted  and
plaited ribbons making geometric patterns, or of intertwined strands
extending from animal and plant motifs. In the 7th and 8th centuries,
interlace ornament was reﬁned and used to great effect by Celtic and
Anglo-Saxon metalworkers, sculptors, and manuscript illuminators. This
artistic tradition was also prominent during the Viking period.

Intermediate Periods: one of the three periods in Egyptian history when
the country was divided into regional potentates instead of being united.
These periods occurred between the Old Kingdom, Middle Kingdom,
New  Kingdom,  and  Late  Period.  The  First  Intermediate  Period  was
2130–1938 bc, the Second Intermediate Period was 1630–1540 bc, and
the Third Intermediate Period was 1075–656 bc. In Andean/Peruvian
archaeology,  there  were  also  intermediate  periods.  The  Early  Inter-
mediate Period (200 bc to ad 600) was characterized by the rise of the
ﬁrst great city states, such as Moche and Nasca. The Late Intermediate
Period (ad 1000–1476) was characterized by the presence of numer-
ous  fractionalized  corporate  units  which  arose  after  the  decline  of
Tiahuanaco and Huari, e.g., Chimu and Aymara.

interstadial: a brief period of milder climate within a longer, cooler glacial
period (between two cold periods during a major glaciation). Although

156 INTERSTADIAL

it  is  similar  to  an  interglacial  period,  it  is  too  cold  or  too  short  to
allow growth of vegetation. Examples are the Devensian, Weichselian,
and Wisconsin.

intrinsic attribute: a characteristic that is inherent in an object, such as

its length, mass, or chemical composition.

invent: to create a new artifact.
invention: creation of a new type of technology, often in response to a

inverse retouch: retouch that occurs on the edge of a lithic ﬂake, visible

only in the ventral view.

Ipswich  ware:  a  pottery  ware  made  in  the  7th  to  9th  centuries  at
Ipswich, England, where kiln debris has been found. The cooking pots
and undecorated pitchers were distributed widely in East Anglia, while
stamp-decorated pitchers were traded as far as York and Richborough.
This ware makes it possible to identify sites of the middle Saxon period.
Ipswichian:  last  interglacial  of  Britain,  equivalent  to  the  Eemian  inter-
glacial of North Europe, with its type site at Bobbit’s Hole, Ipswich.
The Alpine equivalent is the Riss-Würm and the Sangamon is the North
America  equivalent.  The  deposits  indicate  warm  conditions  with 
evidence  of  vertebrate  fossils.  One  radiocarbon  date  of  174,000–
30,000 bp has been found. Levalloisian and Mousterian artifacts are
found in Ipswichian deposits.

Irish  bowl:  type  of  Early  Bronze  Age  ceramic  vessel  of  Ireland  and 
west Scotland, mainly with inhumation burials, from around the early
2nd  millennium  bc.  These  vessels  have  a  small  ﬂat  base,  biconical 
form, sometimes perforated lugs on the carination, and an internally
beveled  rim.  The  upper  part  of  the  body,  neck,  and  rim  are  usually
decorated with impressed cord or other motifs. [Irish food vessel]

iron: a ductile, malleable, magnetic metallic element, used to make arti-
facts of both practical and decorative function. Its oxide form, hematite,
is  found  naturally  and  the  technique  of  ironworking  was  mastered
around 1500 bc by the Hittites. Iron began to spread and replace bronze
for man’s basic tools and weapons – the start of the Iron Age. Early
in  the  1st  millennium  bc,  iron  industries  were  established  in  Greece
and Italy, and by 500 bc iron had replaced bronze for the manufac-
ture of tools and weapons throughout Europe. The pre-Columbian New
World, however, did not develop iron technology. Iron smelting is more
complicated than for copper or tin, since the ﬁrst smelt gives only slaggy
lumps,  the  bloom.  Hammering  at  red  heat  is  then  required  to  expel
the stone fragments and to combine carbon with the iron to make in
effect a steel; the resulting metal is far superior to copper or tin. The
two basic methods of working it are by forging – hammering into shape
at red heat – and casting. The Chinese used the latter method as early

ISOLATE

157

as  the  5th  century  bc,  but  it  was  not  employed  in  Europe  until  the
Middle Ages. The ﬁrst evidence of iron smelting in Egypt dates to the
6th century bc. Large-scale steel manufacture depends on the production
of  cast  iron,  which  in  Europe  dates  only  from  the  14th  century ad.
The  West  did  not  enter  the  “Age  of  Steel”  until  the  19th  century 
with the invention of the Bessemer and Siemens processes, which are
industrial processes for obtaining liquid metal of any desired carbon
content by the decarburization of cast iron. Steel was made in China
within a few centuries of the ﬁrst known use of smelted iron. In prin-
ciple, modern techniques descended from China’s casting techniques.
Iron  Age:  period  during  which  iron  was  utilized  by  early  man,  begin-
ning about 3000 years ago, following the Stone Age and Bronze Age
in the Three Age System. In this period, tools, implements, and weapons
were  ﬁrst  made  of  iron.  Iron  had  many  advantages  over  bronze,  so
its spread was rapid. The Iron Age began at different times in differ-
ent  parts  of  the  world  according  to  the  availability  of  iron  ore  and
the  state  of  knowledge.  In  Europe,  the  earliest  iron  appears  around
1100 bc. The traditional timing of the transition from bronze to iron
is placed in the early 1st millennium bc. The age began about 1500 bc
in the Middle East, about 900 bc in southern Europe, and after 400 bc
in northern Europe. In most of Asia, the Iron Age falls entirely within
the historic period. In America, iron was introduced by the arrival of
Europeans; in Africa, it began before the earlier metal ages. The south-
ern African Iron Age is divided into the Early Iron Age, ad 200–1000,
and the Late Iron Age, ad 1000 until the 19th century. The term is
general and arbitrary. There is evidence that meteorites were used as
a source of iron before 3000 bc, but extraction of the metal from ore
dates from about 2000 bc.

iron pyrites: a nodule of iron pyrites can be used to create ﬁre in com-

bination with tinder and ﬂint or another nodule of iron pyrites.

ironstone: a hard sedimentary rock rich in iron, especially a siderite in
a  coal  region.  This  ore  of  iron,  commonly  a  carbonate,  has  clayey 
impurities. Ironstone china is a hard, heavy, durable white pottery devel-
oped in England early in the 19th century.

ironstone  china:  a  hard,  heavy,  durable  white  pottery  developed  in

England early in the 19th century.

isochrestic style: a style of toolmaking representing the maker’s particu-

lar choices among alternatives in a particular cultural context.

isochronous:  formed  during  the  same  span  of  time.  Isochronal  means
uniform in time, having equal duration, recurring at regular intervals.
isolate: one or two artifacts occurring by themselves and not associated
with an archaeological site; generally thought to represent items lost
or discarded by people as they moved through an area.

158 ISOLATED  DATA

isolated  data:  a  single  object  that  is  found  without  association  to  any
other  artifact  or  feature;  typically  lost  during  travel  or  moved  by  a
relic hunter. Any unassociated archaeological remains.

ivory:  material  from  enlarged  teeth  (or  tusk)  of  certain  mammals  and
used  for  various  tools  and  artifacts  from  the  Upper  Paleolithic.  The
tusks of elephants, mammoths, and walruses have been prized through-
out prehistory and history.

jade:  a  name  applied  to  two  distinct  minerals,  nephrite  and  jadeite;  a
general  term  for  a  semiprecious  stone  used  in  East  Asia  from  the
Neolithic onwards. Jade, in the form of polished axes, was traded in
Neolithic  Europe  but  is  chieﬂy  known  from  contexts  in  China  and
Mesoamerica. It is too hard to be cut or ﬂaked, but may be worked
by abrasion. The most highly prized of the two is jadeite.

jadeite: a rare mineral, the mostly highly prized of the two distinct min-
erals which may be called jade. Much of jadeite is green, but it varies
widely in color. It is a stone carved by Mesoamericans into ornaments
and statuary. Many prehistoric artifacts in Europe are made from jadeite,
but no suitable European resources are known today. Sources of jadeite
are known in Burma, Mexico, and California.

jadeite ax: a thin, highly polished, unperforated implement from the 4th

and 3rd millennia bc in northwest Europe. [jadeite axe]

jar: a wide-mouthed cylindrical container made of glass or pottery.
jasper: a high-quality chert or agate often used as raw material for the
manufacture of stone tools. It is an opaque, ﬁne-grained, or dense vari-
ety of the silica mineral that is mainly brick-red to brownish-red. Jasper
has long been used for jewelry and ornamentation, has a dull luster
but takes a ﬁne polish. Its hardness and other physical properties are
those of quartz. [jasper chert]

160 JAVELIN  HEAD

javelin head: a type of large ﬂint projectile point of the Neolithic in the
British Isles, usually lozenge shaped with slightly convex curves on the
leading edges; sometimes polished and ground on the large ﬂat sides.
Jellinge  style:  an  art  style  that  takes  its  name  from  the  Viking  site  at
Jellinge. Much Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian art from the 9th cen-
tury until the mid 11th century is characterized by animal ornament
and  zoomorphic  motifs,  which  are  usually  disjointed,  stylized,  and
abstract. This type of decoration was most often applied to jewelry,
sculptured crosses, and sculptured stones.

Jemdet Nasr: a small site between Baghdad and Babylon, near Kish, Iraq,
which  has  given  its  name  to  a  period  of  Mesopotamian  chronology
and  its  black-and-red  painted  pottery  ware.  The  period  of  3100–
2900 bc was  characterized  by  writing  in  pictographs,  pottery  with
painted  designs  or  plum-red  burnished  slip,  and  plain  pottery  with
beveled rims. Cylinder seals are squat and plain and a drill was used
in the designs. The period is characterized by increasing populations,
the development of more extensive irrigation systems, towns dominated
by  temples,  increased  use  of  writing  and  cylinder  seals,  more  trade,
and  craft  specialization.  The  period  –  equivalent  to  Uruk  III  of  the
Eanna  Sounding  sequence  –  was  followed  immediately  by  the  Early
Dynastic period of Sumer. A building of Jemdet Nasr date may be the
oldest palace discovered in southern Mesopotamia. [Jamdat Nasr]

Jermanovice point: a type of laurel-leaf point ﬂaked completely on one
side  but  bifacially  only  on  the  lower  part  of  the  blade  and  on  the 
bulb  of  percussion.  From  the  Upper  Paleolithic  Jermanovice  culture
in Poland.

jet: a hard, black, dense form of coal, a lignitic fossil wood. It has been
used  for  decorative  purposes  (beads,  buttons,  etc.)  in  the  British
Bronze  Age  as  it  accepts  a  strong  polish  and  has  good  workability.
Ornaments of jet are found in ancient tumuli. A well-known British
source of jet is at Whitby in Yorkshire.

jetton:  a  token  with  an  engraved  design  used  as  a  gaming  piece  or  in

transactions.

jewelry: decorative objects made mainly for the adornment of the body.
The  art  of  jewelry-making  originated  in  prehistoric  times  when 
early  peoples  used  objects  from  the  animal  world  –  such  as  horn, 
shells, and feathers – to adorn themselves. Cave paintings and carv-
ings show ﬁgures decorated with bracelets, necklaces, and headdresses.
Brooches,  or  ﬁbulae,  were  used  to  fasten  clothes  and  were  made  of
bronze or silver and some were enameled. There were also ﬁnger rings
and earrings.

jiggering: a pottery-forming technique that involves the use of a rotat-
ing mold that leaves its impression on either the interior or exterior

JUAN  KNIFE 161

surface  of  the  vessel,  which  is  otherwise  shaped  by  wheel-throwing.
When the clay body is placed within a concave mold, the process may
be called jollying. In jiggering, an article of ceramic is formed by means
of a rotating mold and proﬁle tool, usually the mold has the contour
of the interior and the proﬁle has the contour of the exterior surface.
[jollying; to jigger (v.)]

joining:  in  large  ceramics  manufacture,  several  primary  components

may be joined with the seam removed or hidden.

jollying:  a  technique  to  form  a  ceramic  hollow  ware  using  a  machine
similar  to  a  jigger,  but  the  rotating  mold  forms  the  outside  while  a
proﬁle forms the interior. [jolleying; to jolly (v.)]

Jomon: earliest major postglacial culture of hunting and gathering in Japan,
10,000–300 bc, divided into six phases. This early culture, its relics
surviving in shell mounds of kitchen midden type around the coasts
of  the  Japanese  islands,  had  pottery  but  no  metal.  The  pottery  was
heavy but elaborate, especially in the modeling of its castellated rims.
The  term  Jomon  means  “cord  marked,”  reﬂecting  the  characteristic
decoration of the pottery with cord-pattern impressions or reliefs. One
of the earliest dates in the world for pottery-making has been estab-
lished as c. 12,700 bc in Fukin Cave, Kyshu. Other artifacts, of stone
and  bone,  were  simple;  light  huts,  round  or  rectangular,  have  been
identiﬁed.  Burials  were  by  inhumation,  crouched  or  extended.  The
Jomon  was  succeeded  by  the  Yayoi  period.  There  are  over  10,000 
Jomon sites divided into the six phases: Incipient (10,000–7500 bc),
Earliest (7500–5000 bc), Early (5000–3500 bc), Middle (3500–2500/
2000 bc),  Late  (2500/2000–1000 bc),  and  Final  (1000–300 bc).
Widespread  trading  networks  and  ritual  development  took  place 
in  the  Middle  Jomon.  Rice  agriculture  was  adopted  during  the  last 
millennium bc.  The  origins  of  Jomon  culture  remain  uncertain,
although  similarities  with  early  cultures  of  northeast  Asia  and  even
America are often cited.

Ju ware: the most highly prized of all Chinese ceramics. Ju wares were
produced exclusively for the Northern Sung emperor Hui-tsung from
about ad 1107  to  1127.  The  original  kiln  site,  Ch’ing-liang-ssu,
yielded 37 examples. The undecorated bluish- or greenish-gray glaze
of Ju wares is cloudy and opaque, often with a pale blue or lavender
tinge  and  ﬁne  irregular  crackle.  This  glaze  typically  covers  a  gray
stoneware body that has a simple, exquisitely elegant shape. [Ru]

Juan  knife:  a  long  ﬂake  with  abrupt  blunting  retouch  along  one  mar-
gin. Ethnographic specimens have handgrips of skin or resin and are
documented from western, central, and eastern Queensland, Australia.
They are very rare in archaeological contexts and are only known from
the last few hundred years.

162 JUE

jue: a bronze wine vessel characteristic of the Shang bronze tradition of

China and used for heating wine in ancestral rituals. [chueh]

jug:  a  deep  container  for  liquids,  with  a  narrow  mouth;  a  cylindrical

container with a handle and a lip, for holding and pouring liquids.

jute: a plant ﬁber used in making rope or sacks.

K

kabal: a turntable used in pottery-making in the New World.
kachina: a deiﬁed ancestral spirit in the mythology of Pueblo Indians.
Kansyore ware: a comb-stamped pottery found at several pre-Iron Age
sites around Lake Victoria in East Africa in the ﬁrst millennium bc.
The makers of Kansyore ware appear to have been hunter-gatherers,
and the makers of a backed microlith industry.

kantharos: in Greek antiquity, a large, two-handled drinking cup. This
type of pottery cup was made in Greek-speaking areas and in Etruria
between the 8th and the 1st centuries bc; it had a deep bowl, a foot,
and  pair  of  high  vertical  handles.  It  was  often  consecrated  to  per-
soniﬁcations  of  Bacchus.  Early  examples  are  often  stemmed.  In  the
4th and 3rd centuries bc, it became one of the most popular types of
drinking vessel in the Greek world. [cantharus]

kaolin: a ﬁne white porcelain clay formed by the weathering of volcanic
rocks. Kaolin is named after the hill in China (Kao-ling) that yielded
the  ﬁrst  clay  of  this  type  sent  to  Europe.  This  soft  white  clay  is  an
essential ingredient in the manufacture of china and porcelain and is
widely  used  in  the  making  of  paper,  rubber,  paint,  and  many  other
products. [china clay]

kaolinite:  a  common  clay  mineral  with  a  two-layer  structure  of  silica

and alumina.

kendi: a spouted water container made in Southeast Asia during the late

1st and early 2nd millennia ad.

Kensington Stone: a stone slab found on a Minnesota farm in 1898 with
an inscription in runes purporting to record the arrival of a party of
exploring Vikings. An object of controversy from the start, it is now
dismissed  as  a  forgery,  despite  recent  conﬁrmation  of  Viking  visits 
to the eastern American coast. This supposed relic of a 14th-century

164 KENSINGTON  STONE

Scandinavian exploration of the interior of North America is a 90 kg
(200-pound) slab of graywacke inscribed with runes (medieval Germanic
script).  The  inscription,  dated  1362,  is  purported  to  be  by  a  group 
of  Norwegian  and  Swedish  explorers  from  Vinland  who  visited  the
Great  Lakes  area  in  that  year.  The  stone  is  housed  in  a  special
museum  in  Alexandria,  Minnesota,  and  a  26-ton  replica  stands  in 
nearby Runestone Park.

Kerbschnitt: technique of carving or decorating wood by use of an ax

or hatchet. [chip carving, chip-carving]

Kerma ware: distinctive thin-walled pottery with a black-and-red ﬁnish,

produced by the Kerma culture in various shapes.

kernos: a Greek cult vessel – dish, bowl, or jar – made of terra cotta or
stucco-covered, sun-baked brick and used for the offering of ﬁrst fruits.
The jar held small cups around its lip and examples are found from
the Bronze Age onwards.

kero:  a  large,  wooden,  ﬂared  beaker,  with  black,  white,  and  light  red
designs of pumas, condors, and other creatures on a dark red back-
ground and decorated with incised geometric patterns. It is found from
Inca  times  through  to  post-conquest  dates,  but  as  pottery  was  used
by the Tiahuanaco culture.

kettle: a vessel, usually made of metal and with a handle, used for boil-

ing liquids or cooking foods; a pot.

kettle  drum:  large  bronze  drums,  also  known  as  Dong  Son  drums
(northern Vietnam), ﬁrst produced more than 2000 years ago and found
throughout Southeast Asia (with the exception of the Philippines and
the island of Borneo). These drums are generally associated with wealth,
power, and fertility and were important in rituals. [Dong Son drums]
key: a small piece of shaped metal with incisions cut to ﬁt the wards of
a particular lock, which is inserted into the lock and rotated to open
or close it or to operate a switch.

key blank: an object that is going to become a key. It has the shape but

has not been cut to ﬁt a lock.

kheker frieze: name of a decorative motif common in ancient Egyptian
architecture from at least as early as the 3rd dynasty (2686–2613 bc).
The motif consists of rows of knots in decorative carved or painted
friezes around the upper edges of buildings.

Khirbet Kerak:  a  Palestinian  site  on  the  southwest  shore  of  the  Sea  of
Galilee, settled from the Early/Middle Bronze Age and occupied again
from the Hellenistic to the Byzantine periods. In the 4th to 3rd mil-
lennia bc,  it  was  a  small  walled  town  which  lent  its  name  to  a  dis-
tinctive pottery ware (Khirbet Kerak ware, c. 3400) which has been
found on many sites throughout the Near East, from Judeidah in Amuq
to Lachish in the south. This highly burnished ware with red or black

KILN 165

slip  is  often  incised  or  ribbed  in  decoration.  Its  origins  lie  up  in  the
southern Caucasus (it was related to early Transcaucasian wares), from
which it was likely carried south by an emigration of the ancestors of
the  Hittites.  The  pottery  belongs  to  the  Early  Bronze  Age  III  phase
and has a wide distribution in Syria and Palestine. It is usually thought
to have originated in northeast Anatolia and may have been distributed
either by emigration or by trade. The town of the mid 3rd millennium
bc contains a massive public building, probably a religious structure,
that comprises eight circular stone structures all enclosed by a massive
outer rectangular wall. [ancient Beth-yerah, Tell Beth Yerah]

Kian ware: a white ware made at Yung-ho near Kian/Chi-an in Kiangsi,
which was often in the form of bowls decorated with leaves, medal-
lions, birds, or plants. It could be black-glazed and was made during
the Sung dynasty (ad 960–1279). This ware appears to be an imita-
tion of Ting. [Chi-an]

kick: raised center of a vessel’s base that rises to a hollow peak.
Killke: a culture and ceramic pottery style of the Cuzco Basin of Peru,
from the Late Intermediate Period, c. ad 1000–1438. It immediately
preceded the Inca style ceramics. Killke pots have globular bodies, white
or buff slip, and simple black (or black and red) geometric patterns.
kiln: a chamber built for the ﬁring (baking) of pottery, used from pre-
historic times. These, usually dome-shaped, structures are designed to
produce the high temperatures needed for the industry. In a pottery
kiln,  the  pots  were  often  stacked  upside-down  on  a  shelf.  An  open-
ing for draft was left at the top, and a ﬂue provided at the side. Fuel
was piled within and around the kiln, and when the heat was at its
greatest the openings were shut to preserve the temperatures and ﬁre
the pots inside, with temperatures of 800–1000°C achieved. Other ver-
sions were used in glassmaking or the parching of corn. The kiln, like
the  potter’s  wheel,  implies  craft  specialization,  and  appears  only  at
advanced  stages  of  economic  development.  Important  types  of  kilns
include: bottle (updraft kiln with a narrow chimney shaped like a bot-
tle), clamp (open-topped updraft kiln of semipermanent construction),
climbing (kiln set along a slope to aid the draft), continuous (in which
ware is fed continuously into the kiln on a track, moving through it
during ﬁring), downdraft (an enclosed periodic kiln in which the heat
is passed to the top of the kiln, then the draft carries it down through
the ware), intermittent or periodic (kiln that is loaded, ﬁred, cooled,
and  then  unloaded  before  ﬁring  a  new  batch),  mufﬂe  (kiln  con-
structed  so  that  the  ware  is  not  directly  subjected  to  the  radiant 
heat from the ﬂame or heating elements), pit (clamp that is dug partly
into  the  ground),  scove  (updraft  kiln  usually  having  no  permanent 
parts),  tunnel  (type  of  continuous  kiln),  and  updraft  (kiln  in  which

166 KILN

the  heat  or  ﬂame  passes  upward  through  the  ware  and  then  is 
vented outside).

kiln  ﬁring:  a  method  of  ﬁring  ceramics  in  which  the  ceramics  are
exposed to the heat from a ﬁre within an ovenlike structure called a
kiln rather than to a direct ﬂame.

Kimberley point: a pressure-ﬂaked bifacial point with serrated margins
and  long  shallow  surface  scar  beds,  found  in  the  Kimberleys  region
of Western Australia and neighboring areas of the Northern Territory
and northwest Queensland. South of the Kimberleys, the point was a
trade item and was used as a surgical knife. The points were made at
the time of European contact, when bottle glass and porcelain were
adapted for the industry.

Kingdoms,  Old,  Middle,  and  New:  names  traditionally  applied  to  the
three  peak  periods  of  development  in  the  history  of  ancient  Egypt, 
separated by times of decline and disorder. The Old Kingdom included
the  3rd  to  6th  dynasties,  c.  2700–2200 bc;  the  Middle  Kingdom
included  the  11th  to  13th  dynasties,  2100–1650 bc;  and  the  New
Kingdom consisted of the 18th to 20th dynasties, 1580–1075 bc.

Klepsydra: a spring on the northwest slope of the Acropolis of Athens.
It  is  also  the  name  of  a  Greek  water  clock  with  one  basin  draining
into a second basin at a lower level. [klepsydra]

kleroterion:  an  ancient  machine  used  to  decide  who  would  serve  on  a
jury in courts of law. There are surviving examples, such as the one
from the Agora at Athens. Different colored balls would drop when
tickets were inserted; the color determined acceptance or rejection.

kline:  a  Greek  couch  with  a  headboard  and  sometimes  a  footboard, 
used  for  reclining  during  a  symposium.  Their  placement  in  dining 
rooms  is  revealed  on  archaeological  sites  by  the  placement  of
entrance doors.

knapper: one who manufactures stone artifacts.
knapping:  working  of  stone  by  applying  force  to  its  surface  –  by 
percussion  or  pressure  –  to  produce  a  tool.  A  knapper  is  one  who 
manufactures  stone  artifacts,  especially  by  chipping.  This  technique
of striking ﬂakes or blades from a hard, brittle rock, such as ﬂint or
obsidian, is done by means of short, sharp blows delivered with a ham-
mer  of  stone,  bone,  or  wood.  Knapping  was  used  to  fashion  stone
tools and weapons, such as blades and arrowheads, in the Harappan
culture of the Indus Valley and was also applied to making beads from
agate and carnelian.

Knapton ware: a type of crude handmade pottery c. 4th century ad in

Humberside of northeastern England.

knife: a backed blade; a cutting instrument composed of a blade and a

handle into which it is ﬁxed, either rigidly or with a joint.

KOFUN,  KOFUN

Knives

knife-trimming: pottery technique using a knife to pare away the surface
of a pot; the effect was sometimes used decoratively so as to produce
facets around the vessel.

knight jug: a type of medieval jug with a tubular spout and horses and
knights decorating the body, dating to the 14th century ad and later
in Europe.

knobbed: in lithics, a stem form having a rounded lump or protruding

appearance.

kodja: a type of ﬂaked stone hatchet of southwest Australia, made with
two stones hafted in a ball of resin on the end of a stick, known for
2000–3000  years.  One  stone  is  used  for  pounding  and  the  other  is
sharp for chopping. [kodj]

kofun,  Kofun:  name  of  the  protohistoric  tomb  period  of  Japan,
ad 300–710, and the type of tumulus used for the burials. Large tombs
were  built  that  were  covered  with  artiﬁcial  hillocks  about  8 m  (26
feet) high, with burial chambers about 2 m (6.5 feet) underneath the
top surface. The burial chamber, enclosed with stones, contained cofﬁns
and various funerary offerings. The period when tombs of this kind
were built in abundance was characterized by Haji ware and Sue ware.
It is divided into Early (4th century), Middle (5th century), and Late
(late 5th to 7th centuries). The Kofun period falls between the Yayoi
period  and  the  fully  historic  Nara  period  and  partially  overlaps  the

168 KOFUN,  KOFUN

Asuka and Hakuho periods of art historians. In their writings, the Kojiki
and Nihon Shoki texts, the culture was explained. Early kofun were
built by modifying natural hills, as were Late Yayoi burial mounds.
Haji pottery, used throughout the Kofun period, is very similar to Yayoi
pottery and farmers lived in the same kinds of houses, using very sim-
ilar tools. Technical advances over the Yayoi period include irrigation
canals  and  dams.  There  were  also  silversmiths  who  made  the  orna-
ments deposited in the kofun, and professional potters began making
Sue pottery in the 5th century. Those in the fertile and well-protected
Yamato Basin actively sought new technical and administrative skills
on the continent and thus artisans came to make new kinds of pot-
tery,  ornaments,  and  weapons.  Yamato  leaders  gained  control  over
much of Japan in the 7th century and moved the capital to Heijo in
ad 710. The magniﬁcent kofun tombs indicate that the Yamato court
based in the Yamato area (the present Nara prefecture) succeeded in
bringing almost the whole of Japan under its control.

Kon-Tiki: replica of a balsa raft constructed by Thor Heyerdahl in 1947
to test the hypothesis that South American Indians could have drifted
into Polynesia. This was the type of raft used in the 16th century ad
along the coasts of Ecuador and northern Peru. Heyerdahl sailed the
raft  from  South  America  to  the  Tuamotu  Archipelago  to  show  that
Indians could have reached Polynesia. Archaeological evidence, how-
ever, has shown that any contacts were only of a minor nature.

kore: a type of freestanding statue of a maiden – the female counterpart
of the kouros or standing youth – that appeared with the beginning
of Greek monumental sculpture in about 660 bc and remained to the
end of the Archaic period in about 500 bc. It evolved from a highly
stylized form to a more naturalistic one. The statue was usually draped,
carved from marble, and painted in its original form. They are often
dedications  in  sanctuaries  and  some  are  found  in  funeral  contexts.
Important  series  were  in  the  temple  of  Hera  on  Samos  and  on  the
Acropolis in Athens. [korai (pl.)]

Korean periodization: classiﬁcation of the eras of Korea by archaeolo-
gists  and  historians.  The  major  divisions  following  the  Paleolithic 
are: Chulmun, 7000–1000 bc; Bronze Age, 700 bc to ad 1; Iron Age,
400 bc to ad 300; Proto-Three Kingdoms, ad 1–300; Three Kingdoms,
ad 300–668;  United  Silla,  668–935;  Koryo,  935–1392;  Yi,  1392–
1910; Japanese Colonial, 1910–1945; Modern, 1945 to present.

kotyle: a Greek drinking cup with two horizontal handles. [skyphos]
kouros:  a  Greek  statue  of  a  youth  or  a  standing  nude  male  youth,  of
the Archaic period. The large stone ﬁgures began to appear in Greece
about  615–590 bc.  They  were  funerary  markers  or  dedications  in 
sanctuaries. They were usually larger than life size, made of marble,

KUDURRU

169

bronze, or alabaster, and were sometimes painted. The kouros is thought
to have been inﬂuenced by Egyptian sculpture; the ﬁrst appearance of
such monumental stone ﬁgures seems to coincide with the reopening
of Greek trade with Egypt in c. 672 bc. The kouros remained a popu-
lar  form  of  sculpture  until  about  460 bc.  The  female  equivalent  is 
called a kore. [kouroi (pl.)]

krater:  ancient  Greek  vessel  used  for  diluting  wine  with  water.  It  usu-
ally  stood  on  a  tripod  in  the  dining  room,  where  wine  was  mixed.
Kraters were made of metal or pottery and were often painted or elab-
orately ornamented. In Homer’s Iliad the prize offered by Achilles for
the foot race at Patroclus’ funeral games was a silver krater. The Greek
historian  Herodotus  describes  many  enormous  and  costly  kraters
dedicated  at  temples  or  used  in  religious  ceremonies.  Kraters  are
large, with a broad body and base and usually a wide mouth. They
may have horizontal handles placed near the base, or vertical handles
rising from the shoulder. Among the many variations are: the bell krater,
conﬁned to red-ﬁgure pottery, shaped like an inverted bell, with loop
handles and a disk foot; the volute krater, with an egg-shaped body
and handles that rise from the shoulder and curl in a volute (scroll-
shaped form) well above the rim; the calyx krater, the shape of which
spreads out like the cup or calyx of a ﬂower; and the column krater,
with columnar handles rising from the shoulder to a ﬂat, projecting
lip  rim.  Some  were  ﬁtted  with  a  strainer.  [bell  crater,  calyx  crater, 
column crater, crater, volute crater]

Krukowski microburin: a tool backed like a La Mouillah point but the

scar runs back onto the body of the bladelet.

kshemenitsa: a term for a dense scatter of ﬂint artifacts and debitage on
a  Late  Paleolithic  or  Mesolithic  site  in  eastern  Europe,  indicating  a
ﬂint working site.

Kuan ware: ﬁne Chinese stoneware of the Sung dynasty, ad 960–1279,
characterized by a wash of brown slip and by glazes varying from pale
green to lavender-blue. A wide-meshed crackle is brought out by the
application of brown pigment. First made in north China, Kuan ware
was produced from about 1127 at Hang-chou, Chekiang province, in
the south. [Guan ware]

kudurru:  1.  An  Akkadian  term  meaning  frontier,  or  boundary,  for  a 
type of boundary stone used by the Kassites of Mesopotamia. It was
a  stone  block  or  slab  which  served  as  a  record  of  a  grant  of  land 
made  by  the  king  to  a  favored  person.  The  original  kudurrus  were
kept  in  temples,  while  clay  copies  were  given  to  the  landowners. 
On  the  stone  were  engraved  the  clauses  of  the  contract,  the  images 
or  symbols  of  the  gods  under  whose  protection  the  gift  was  placed,
and  the  curse  on  those  who  violated  the  rights  conferred.  The 

170 KUDURRU

kudurrus are important not only for economic and religious reasons
but  also  as  almost  the  only  works  of  art  surviving  from  the  period 
of  Kassite  rule  in  Babylonia,  around  the  16th  to  12th  centuries  bc.
The  term  also  applies  to  the  3rd  millennium  cuneiform  documents 
in  southern  Mesopotamia  that  record  land  transfers.  2.  The  word 
also  means  “son,”  as  in  personal  names  such  as  Nabu-kudurri-usur
(Nebuchadnezzar).

k’uei: a bronze bowl with handles for food, of the Zhou/Chou dynasty

of China.

Kulli:  an  important  Chalcolithic  culture  and  pottery  style  of  south
Baluchistan.  The  pottery  is  mainly  buff  and  wheelmade,  painted  in
black with friezes of elongated humped bulls, cats, or goats and spiky
trees between zones of geometric ornament. Clay ﬁgurines of women
and bulls are found in this culture, as are copper tools and ornaments
of lapis lazuli, bone, and other materials. The culture is further dis-
tinguished  from  those  of  Amri-Nal  in  the  same  area  by  the  practice
of  cremation  burial;  an  important  cemetery  was  excavated  at  Mehi.
Mud-brick  architecture  and  small  tell  sites  are  common  to  the  two
cultures. There are signs of Indus civilization inﬂuences on later Kulli
material with carved stone vessels identical with examples from Early
Dynastic Mesopotamia, dating to the early 3rd millennium bc.

kyathos: a Greek or Etruscan dipper of silver, bronze, or clay which con-

sists of a small bowl at the end of a long handle.

kylix:  a  Greek  stemmed  drinking  cup  or  chalice,  usually  made  of  clay
or  metal.  The  term  was  originally  used  for  a  cup  of  any  form,  but
modern scholars restrict it to shallow two-handed stemmed forms. This
wide-bowled drinking cup with horizontal handles was one of the most
popular  pottery  forms  from  Mycenaean  times  through  the  Classical
Athenian period. There was usually a painted frieze around the outer
surface, depicting a subject from mythology or everyday life, and on
the bottom of the inside a painting often depicting a dancing or drink-
ing scene. [cylix]

La  Mouillah  point:  a  point  like  a  piquant-triedre  except  that  it  is
backed,  the  tip  is  then  twisted  off  so  the  microburin  scar  forms  an
extended point.

La  Tène  art:  an  art  style  of  the  European  Iron  Age,  c.  500 bc,  devel-
oped presumably by Celtic peoples. It originated on the middle Rhine
River, extending to the upper Danube and the Marne. Its ﬁnest speci-
mens are from the British Isles in the 1st century bc and ad. It appears
most commonly in bronzework or other metals, weapons and horse
gear, eating and drinking vessels, personal ornaments, and monumental
stone  carvings.  It  seems  likely  that  the  craftsmen  worked  under  the
direct patronage of the chieftains. Techniques employed were decora-
tion  in  relief,  engraving,  and  inlay.  Stylistically,  Celtic  art  combines
elements  taken  from  the  Classical  world,  from  the  Scythians  to  the
east and from the local earlier Hallstatt Iron Age. The art developed
into  several  styles  in  continental  Europe  (Early,  Waldalgesheim,
Plastic,  and  Sword  styles)  but  came  to  an  end  with  the  Roman 
occupation.  In  Ireland,  the  art  style  returned  after  the  Roman  with-
drawal. [Celtic art]

labret:  a  lip  plug  or  ornament  inserted  in  an  incision  in  the  lower  lip,
often made of shell, bone, ivory, metal, stone, wood, or pottery. Some-
times a succession would be worn, each larger than the predecessor.
Labrets indicated the eminence of the wearer, e.g., women of high rank
of  the  northwest  coast  of  North  America.  Although  styles  vary  and
labrets  were  particularly  popular  in  Mesoamerica,  they  occur  in 
artifact inventories from the Arctic to the Andes. [labrum]

labrum:  a  large,  shallow  basin  for  hot  water,  set  on  a  pedestal  and 
usually carved from marble, granite, or a ﬁne-grained stone, and found
in a Roman bath house.

LACONIAN  POTTERY

Laconian pottery: Spartan pottery made in the 6th century bc, charac-
terized  as  black-ﬁgured  and  black-glossed.  The  fabric  was  widely
exported – to Cyrenaica, Etruria, and Greek colonies in Italy.

lacquer:  the  resin  of  the  sumac  tree,  used  as  a  coating  to  harden  and
strengthen  manufactured  items.  This  varnishing  substance  was  used
from  prehistoric  times  and  was  indigenous  to  southern  and  central
China. Applied in many coats to a core made of wood, fabric, paper,
baskets, leather, ceramics, etc., it forms a tough and durable protec-
tive surface, resistant to water, and capable of a high polish. In China
lacquered vessels were made as early as the Shang dynasty. Lacquer
is often colored red or black.

lacquer ware: a type of ornate, wooden, domestic and funerary vessels
of  China  from  the  Shang  dynasty  (14th  century bc)  onwards,  made
by multiple layers of lacquer on a wooden or fabric preform to create
a rich shiny surface.

ladle: a long-handled scoop usually used with liquids.
lagena: a Greek or Roman earthenware vessel with a globular body, used

for holding wine, vegetables, or fruit.

lagynos: a Greek or Roman jug with a low, squat body, vertical neck,

rounded mouth, and single strap handle.

lamassu: colossal stone ﬁgures – part human, part animal – carved on
the doorways of Assyrian and Achaemenid buildings, as at Nineveh.
They were guardian ﬁgures.

Lambeth sword: a type of Late Bronze Age straight-sided bronze sword
with a ﬂat mid-section and rectangular hilt tang, of southern Britain
in the 12th and 11th centuries bc (Penard phase).

laminating:  the  production  of  a  high-quality  metal  tool  or  weapon  by
repeatedly forging out a blank form, folding the metal over and forging
it again so that qualities of malleability and hardness can be combined.
lamp:  a  device  for  producing  illumination,  consisting  originally  of  a 
vessel  containing  a  wick  soaked  in  combustible  material.  The  lamp
was invented by at least 70,000 bc and was originally a hollowed-out
rock ﬁlled with an absorbent material soaked with animal fat and lit.
Simple saucers of stone or chalk for this purpose go back to the Upper
Paleolithic.  In  pottery,  the  use  can  rarely  be  proved  unless  a  special
spout  or  pinched  lip  was  provided  to  support  the  wick,  or  signs  of
burning  have  survived  at  the  rim.  In  ancient  Greece,  lamps  did  not
begin to appear until the 7th century bc, when they replaced torches
and braziers.

lamp-ﬁller: a globular, narrow-mouthed jar with a projecting spout of

very narrow bore.

lamp-holder: a shallow, ﬂat-bottomed, asymmetrical dish, shaped like a

jug’s mouth, and usually having a handle, from Roman times.

LAPITA

lance: a long spear used on horseback.
lancehead:  a  large,  ﬂat  missile  point  of  stone,  bone,  ivory,  or  metal  –
larger than an arrowhead and smaller than a spearhead. It is assumed
to  have  armed  a  light  lance  or  javelin  and  was  mounted  on  a  long
shaft for hunting or war.

lanceolate: shaped like a lancehead, referring to projectile points taper-
ing to a point at the apex and sometimes at the base. The term is often
applied to ﬂaked stone blades of laurel-leaf form, much like spearheads.

Types of lanceolates

lancet: a pointed, two-edged surgical knife.
landscape signature: the material remains of human activities across the

landscape.

lapis lazuli: a semiprecious stone of an intense blue color, very popular
in the ancient Near East for decorative inlays, beads, seals, etc. It is
a metamorphosed form of limestone, rich in the blue mineral lazurite,
which is dark blue in color and often ﬂecked with impurities of cal-
cite, iron pyrites, or gold. Its main source was Badakhshan, northern
Afghanistan, and Iran, from which it was traded as far as Egypt. The
Egyptians considered that its appearance imitated that of the heavens,
therefore they considered it to be superior to all materials other than
gold and silver. They used it extensively in jewelry until the Late Period
(664–332 bc), when it was particularly popular for amulets. One of
the richest collections of lapis lazuli objects was found in the burials
at Tepe Gawra. It has also been found at Ovalle, Chile.

Lapita:  a  major  Oceanic  culture  complex,  named  after  the  type  site 
of Lapita, New Caledonia. It is deﬁned by a distinctive type of pot-
tery with dentate-stamped, banded decoration in geometric patterns,
appearing c. 3500 bp throughout much of the western Paciﬁc, includ-
ing  Fiji  and  Samoa.  Most  Lapita  sites  are  on  offshore  islands  and 
assemblages  include  elaborate  shell  tools  and  ornaments,  the  use  of
obsidian,  and  stone  adzes.  The  obsidian  and  pottery  style  suggest 
long-distance  trade.  The  culture  is  almost  certainly  associated  with 
ancestral  Polynesians  moving  eastwards  from  island  Southeast  Asia 
(perhaps from the Philippines), through previously inhabited Melanesia,
to  the  hitherto  empty  islands  of  Tonga  and  Samoa  in  western

174

LAPITA

Polynesia. The culture therefore represents the origin of the Polynesians
prior to their settlement of geographic Polynesia. It is thought to be
associated with the spread of Austronesian speakers into the Western
Paciﬁc. [Lapita pottery]

larnax: 1. A Minoan-Mycenaean clay or terra cotta cofﬁn. This kind of
cofﬁn, resembling a rectangular wooden chest, enjoyed a brief popu-
larity in the eastern Greek region c. 530–460 bc. The sarcophagus was
often crudely painted on the sides with funerary or religious scenes.
“Clazomenian” examples were painted in imitation of contemporary
vase styles. 2. The term was also used for a closed box, seen in a royal
tomb at Vergina, and in art. 3. A bathtub made of a fabric contain-
ing straw. [larnakes (pl.)]

Last  Glacial  Maximum:  the  geological  period  dating  between  25,000 
and 14,000 bp, during which global temperatures reached the lowest
levels of the Upper Pleistocene (127,000–10,000 bp). Massive conti-
nental ice sheets formed in the northern hemisphere and sea levels fell
worldwide. The people were anatomically modern and conducted indus-
tries of the Upper Paleolithic in unglaciated parts of the Old World.
latch:  a  small  bar  raised  or  lowered  by  a  latch-lifter  which  is  used  to

fasten gates or doors, etc.

latch-lifter: a type of early key in Roman and early medieval times – a
bent  piece  of  iron  rod  with  an  expanded  end  that  could  be  pushed
through a hole in a wooden door to raise a catch-bar on the inside.
Late Bronze Age: a period of the Levant, following the expulsion of the
Hyksos,  during  which  the  Egyptians  invaded  and  Canaanite  cities 
were under Egyptian control. It is divided into the Late Bronze Age
(LBA) I, c. 1550–1400 bc; LBA Iia, c. 1400–1300 bc; and LBA Iib,
c. 1300–1200 bc.

Late Glacial: the closing stages of the Pleistocene Ice Age, when the glaciers
had begun their ﬁnal retreat and when much of northern Europe was
tundra. This period lasted from c. 13,000 to 8500 bc. The substages
in northern Europe are the Oldest Dryas (13,000–10,450 bc), the Bølling
oscillation  (10,450–10,050),  the  Older  Dryas  (10,050–9850),  the
Allerød oscillation (9850–8850), and the Younger Dryas (8850–8300).
Cultures  of  the  Late  Glacial  period  include  the  Ahrensburgian,
Creswellian, Federmesser, and Hamburgian.

Late  Horizon:  a  division  of  time  in  central  Andean  chronology, 
c. ad 1450–1533, which corresponds to the Inca Empire’s expansion
from Cuzco. It is the most recent and briefest period of a chronolo-
gical  construction  of  Peruvian  archaeology.  The  start  date  marks 
the  point  at  which  territorial  expansion  was  virtually  complete;  the
end date marks the passing of control to the Spanish under Pizarro.
Archaeologists  have  come  to  distinguish  the  various  peoples  and 

LATER  STONE  AGE

175

civilizations by descriptive terms – the Late Preceramic, the Initial (or
Lower Formative) Period, the Early Horizon, the Early Intermediate
Period, the Middle Horizon, the Late Intermediate Period, and the Late
Horizon. [see Andean chronology]

Late Intermediate Period: a division of time in central Andean chrono-
logy, c. ad 1000–1450, which was a period of regional diversiﬁcation
on the coast and in the highlands. New styles, cultures, and kingdoms
arose  after  the  collapse  of  the  Middle  Horizon  empires.  The  period
began  with  the  dying  out  of  the  signs  of  unity  imposed  by  Huari.
Warfare, secularization of urban centers, and rectangular enclosure plans
were  prominent.  The  cultures  and  styles  were  the  Chimú,  Chancay,
Pachacamac, Chincha, Ica, Cajamarca, Chanca, Killke, Lucre, Colla,
and  Lupaca.  The  various  empires  that  developed  during  the  Late
Intermediate Period were conquered by the Inca Empire.

Late  Period:  a  phase  of  Egyptian  history,  c.  664–332 bc comprising
the  26th  to  31st  dynasties,  stretching  from  the  end  of  the  Third
Intermediate  Period  to  the  arrival  of  Alexander  the  Great.  Shabaqo
(716–702 bc), the second ruler of the Kushite 25th dynasty, exerted
Nubian  inﬂuence  by  moving  the  administrative  center  back  from
Thebes to Memphis. In writing, the demotic script – the new cursive
form – was introduced from the north and spread gradually through
the country. Hieratic was, however, retained for literary and religious
texts, among which very ancient material, such as the Pyramid Texts,
was  revived  and  inscribed  in  tombs  and  on  cofﬁns  and  sarcophagi.
The Late Period also saw the greatest development of animal worship
in Egypt.

late stage biface: a biface in the ﬁnal step of manufacture, usually with

relatively straight edges and complex surface topography.

Late  Woodland  period:  a  period  of  time,  c.  ad 400–1000,  in  the
American  Midwest,  when  populations  spread  west  to  the  eastern
slopes of the Rockies and were in contact with the eastward-moving
Pueblo  people.  A  favorable  agricultural  period  was  indicated  by  the
marked increase in village size and in population density. Areas along
major streams were occupied by various interrelated cultural groups
collectively  known  as  the  Plains  Mississippian  cultures.  Part  of  this
complex was connected to the developing Mississippian complexes to
the east by diffusion and, to some degree, by a migration of such groups
as the Omaha and Ponca from the St. Louis area by about ad 1000.
It follows the Middle Woodland era but lacks the elaborate Hopewellian
artifacts and structures.

Later  Stone  Age:  the  third  and  ﬁnal  phase  of  Stone  Age  technology 
in  sub-Saharan  Africa,  dating  from  about  30,000+ years  ago  until 
historic  times  in  some  places.  There  was  a  lot  of  art  and  personal 

176

LATER  STONE  AGE

decoration,  evidence  of  burials,  and  some  microlithic  stone  tools  in
assemblages. Pottery and stone bowls appear during the last three mil-
lennia as the lifestyle changed to herding from nomadic hunting and
gathering. The large number of distinctive Later Stone Age industries
that emerged, reﬂected the increasing specialization as hunter-gatherers
exploited different environments, often moving seasonally between them,
and developed different subsistence strategies. As in many parts of the
world, changes in technology seem to mark a shift to the consump-
tion of smaller game, ﬁsh, invertebrates, and plants. Later Stone Age
peoples used bows and arrows and a variety of snares and traps for
hunting, as well as grindstones and digging sticks for gathering plant
food; with hooks, barbed spears, and wicker baskets they also were
able  to  catch  ﬁsh  and  thus  exploit  rivers,  lakeshores,  and  seacoasts
more effectively. The appearance of cave art, careful burials, and ostrich
eggshell  beads  for  adornments  suggests  more  sophisticated  behavior
and new patterns of culture. These developments apparently are asso-
ciated with the emergence between 20,000 and 15,000 bc of the earliest
of the historically recognizable populations of southern Africa – the
Pygmy, San, and Khoi peoples – who were probably genetically related
to the ancient population that had evolved in the African subcontinent.

lateral: positioned away from the midline, to the left or right.
lateral  ﬂutes:  the  initial,  usually  short,  ﬂutes  that  were  removed  from
either side of the midportion of the basal edge to form a striking plat-
form for the removal of the median ﬂute.

lateral  section:  a  cross-section  in  which  the  cut  is  made  perpendicular
to the base line of the artifact drawing and the outline of the section
is  oriented  like  a  proﬁle  view  but  in  horizontal  alignment  with  the
points through which the cut was made.

lattice: a structure or pattern consisting of strips crossing each other with

square or diamond-shaped spaces left between.

laurel-leaf point: a distinctive long, thin, leaf-shaped Solutrean ﬂake tool
made with delicate workmanship. The largest was found from Volgu,
France. It was made during the Upper Paleolithic in Europe. [laurel-
leaf blade]

Laurentide: the ice mass that covered most of Canada and parts of the
United  States,  including  the  Great  Lakes  area  and  northern  New
England,  during  the  Pleistocene  epoch.  It  originated  in  northeastern
Canada during the Wisconsin glacial and then spread south and west.
At its maximum extent, about 20,000 years ago, it was connected with
the  Cordilleran  ice  sheet  to  the  west  and  covered  an  area  of  more 
than 13,000,000 km2 (5,000,000 square miles). In some areas its thick-
ness reached 2400–3000 m (8000–10,000 feet). The system began to
recede about 14,000 bp.

LEGIONARY  WARE

177

Le Croy point: an Early Archaic bifurcate, chipped-stone projectile point
of the US southeast, small- or medium-sized with short triangular blades.
They are dated to c. 6500–6000 bc and are found in the Ohio and
Tennessee river drainages and north to the Great Lakes. [LeCroy]

lead: a soft, silvery-white or grayish metal that is very malleable, ductile,
and dense and is a poor conductor of electricity. Known in antiquity
and believed by the alchemists to be the oldest of metals, lead is highly
durable and resistant to corrosion, as is indicated by the continuing
use of lead water pipes installed by the ancient Romans. In antiquity,
galena (from which silver may also be extracted) was the main source
of lead in the Old World, although anglesite and cerussite were also
exploited. Lead was used to make patterns for casting, to “wet” bronze
and ease its casting; in making glazes; and, alloyed with tin, to make
soft  solder  for  joining  metals  and  pewter  for  tablewares  as  well  as 
for pipes, rooﬁng, etc. The ﬁrst evidence for lead extraction in parts
of  Europe  was  the  addition  of  the  metal  to  bronze  during  the  Late
Bronze Age.

lead glaze: a type of glaze found on European pottery and the soft-ﬁred
earthenware of the Han dynasty of China. It was probably invented
by the Greeks and/or Romans by the 3rd century bc, involving either
dusting the unﬁred vessel with galena (lead ore) or dipping it into a
mixture of lead ore and water. The glaze fuses in one ﬁring. The nat-
ural color of lead glaze has a yellowish tinge; after the 13th century
copper  ore  was  often  added  to  give  a  greenish-gray  effect.  In  China
it was used for vessels and miniature ceramic sculptures in funerary
deposits. [lead-glazed ware]

leaf  arrowhead:  a  leaf-  or  diamond-shaped  arrowhead  with  shallow

retouching at the edges.

leaf-shaped: of a tool, pointed at the ends and with convex sides, as on
a  willow  leaf.  The  term  is  applied  to  an  arrowhead,  the  blade  of  a
slashing sword, or the ﬂattened bow of a ﬁbula and other tools which
have been retouched on both faces to produce a ﬂattish effect. Many
Upper Paleolithic tools are named after leaves (e.g., Solutrean laurel
leaf).  Some  Middle  Paleolithic  industries  were  characterized  by  the 
presence  of  bifaces,  others  by  the  presence  of  leaf-shaped  objects.
Mousterian industries produced leaf-shaped items in central and east-
ern Europe. [foliate, foliated]

leather-hard: a stage in the manufacture of ceramic artifacts between form-
ing  and  ﬁring  when  the  clay  is  sufﬁciently  dry  to  lose  plasticity  but
still can be polished to compact its surface.

legionary ware: types of pottery used by Roman legions in Britain in the
mid 1st century ad, speciﬁc to legions such as the Wroxeter, Lincoln,
York, and Caerleon.

LEILIRA

leilira:  a  large,  pointed  or  rectangular  blade  that  may  be  retouched  to
form  a  point  or  scraper-like  tool.  It  could  be  hafted  as  a  spearhead
or ﬁghting pick or used as a knife. It is associated with the Australian
Small Tool tradition in northern Australia.

leister: a two-pronged, fork-like ﬁsh spear made of two bone or antler
heads with barbs pointing inwards and backwards. They are recorded
from Mesolithic and lakeside Neolithic settlements, as well as present
day use by the Inuits, mainly for salmon.

lekanis: in Greek antiquity, a shallow basin, usually with two horizon-
tal handles and ﬁtted with a lid or cover which could be reversed to
act as a stemmed plate. There are red-ﬁgured examples decorated with
scenes of women. [lekane]

lekythos: in ancient Greece, a pottery oil ﬂask used at baths and gym-
nasiums and for funerary offerings. The ﬂask has a long, cylindrical
body gracefully tapered to the base, and a narrow neck with a single
loop-shaped handle. The body was often covered with white slip and
then painted in polychrome. [lecythus; lecythi, lekythoi (pl.)]

lenticular:  meaning  “lens-shaped;”  any  object  with  a  biconvex  cross-
section; also a term used to describe the cross-section of a blade that
is excurvate on both faces thus looking like a convex lens or an ellipse.
[elliptical]

lepaste: a large vessel shaped like a cylix but resting on a broad stand,

used for holding pure wine.

leptolithic:  describing  industries  with  many  blades  and  blade  tools,
especially end scrapers, burins, and backed blades, typical of the Upper
Paleolithic. The term leptolithic, literally “of small stones,” has some-
times been used speciﬁcally to refer to this type of stone technology,
without any dating connotation or evolutionary position.

Lerma point: a projectile point made before 7000 bc in Tamaulipas and
Puebla, Mexico. It is laurel-leaf-shaped and similar to those found in
the Great Basin of the US.

Levallois core: a prepared core from which a single ﬂake or blade has
been  produced.  The  technique  was  primarily  used  in  the  Paleolithic
and Neolithic.

Levallois  ﬂake:  a  ﬂake  produced  from  a  carefully  prepared  core.

[Levallois point]

Levallois technique: a distinctive method of stone toolmaking in which
ﬂakes  are  removed  by  percussion  from  a  preshaped  core,  with  little
other  modiﬁcation.  This  prepared-core  knapping  technique  allows 
the removal of large ﬂakes of predetermined size and shape. The face
of  the  core  is  trimmed  to  shape  in  order  to  control  the  form  and 
size  of  the  intended  ﬂake.  Characteristically  the  preparatory  ﬂaking 
is  directed  from  the  periphery  of  the  core  towards  the  center.  The 

LID-SEATED  VESSEL

179

residual core is shaped rather like a tortoise, with one face plane and
the other domed, while the ﬂake shows the scars of the preparatory
work on one face and is plane on the other. It is named for Levallois-
Perret,  a  suburb  of  Paris,  where  such  artifacts  were  ﬁrst  discovered.
The  Levallois  technique  was  known  from  the  Acheulian  period  and
was employed by certain late Lower Paleolithic hand-ax makers, and
throughout the Middle Paleolithic by some Mousterian communities.
It  lasted  into  the  Upper  Paleolithic  of  the  Levant,  and  in  the  Epi-
Levalloisian industries of Egypt. [Levallois facies]

Levalloisian: pertaining to the Levallois technique or describing tools made
by  this  method  of  producing  ﬂint  ﬂakes  from  a  prepared  core.  It  is
also  the  name  of  the  Middle  Paleolithic  culture  or  industry  of  the 
second  interglacial  in  France,  characterized  by  the  introduction  and
reﬁnement of ﬂake tools. The name is derived from Levallois-Perret,
a suburb of Paris, where such artifacts were ﬁrst discovered. [Levallois,
Levalloisian ﬂake technique]

Levanna projectile point: projectile points are usually associated with Late
Woodland and Contact Period occupations in southern New England
(c.  700–300 bp).  Common  material  types  associated  with  this  point
include quartz, quartzite, hornfels, and basalt. Nonlocal cherts were
also used in the manufacture of this point type. The Levanna point type
is characterized by the equilateral triangular form and concave base.
Levantine art: rock art found mainly in eastern Spain and dating to the
Neolithic period. Small red-painted deer, ibex, humans, etc. were used
in hunting scenes. The art was once assigned to the Mesolithic.

lever: a bar used to increase the force being brought to bear in order to

move an object.

levigate:  in  pottery-making,  a  method  of  purifying  clay  by  sedimenta-
tion. The clay is thoroughly mixed with water and then left to stand
so  the  coarser  particles  sink  to  the  bottom  while  the  water  and  any
organic impurities rise to the top and can be poured off. The middle
contains a layer of ﬁne-textured clay.

li: a cooking vessel common in the Chinese Neolithic and Bronze Ages
in  both  pottery  and  bronze.  It  is  a  small  tripod  bowl  with  hollow 
legs,  characteristic  of  the  Henan  and  Shaanxi  Longshan  cultures
(Hougang II, Kexingzhuang II), that in Shang and Zhou/Chou times
was  copied  in  bronze.  The  Xian  steamer  was  a  perforated  bowl  set
atop  a  li  and  ﬁrst  appeared  in  Henan  Longshan  pottery  and  bronze
in the Shang period.

lian: Chinese term for lacquered wooden box in which toilet necessities

or food such as cooked cereals are kept.

lid-seated  vessel:  a  pot  in  which  the  rim  is  ledged,  dished,  or  grooved

internally to keep a lid in place.

180

LIENZO

lienzo: a large document similar to a codex, made of an animal skin or
cloth. The major difference is that a lienzo is either rectangular or irre-
gular and a codex is a folded scroll. In Mesoamerica, the lienzo is fre-
quently a map showing elite land holdings. Its name comes from Spanish
for “linen,” and all surviving specimens are post-conquest.

lifting: in wheel-throwing pottery, a vessel that involves using hands or
ﬁngers to squeeze the vessel walls thinner and higher as the body rotates.
limace: a type of blade tool retouched along both sides to form a slug-

shaped object.

lime popping: a surface defect on ware containing inclusions of calcium

carbonate (limestone, shell, calcite). [lime blowing]

limpet scoop: a small stone tool usually made from an elongated pebble,

one end beveled off to form a rough blade.

linchpin: a metal spike, sometimes enlarged at one end, that passed through
a  hole  in  the  end  of  a  ﬁxed  axle  to  stop  the  wheel  from  falling  off.
[linch pin]

line  sinker:  a  weight  attached  to  a  ﬁshing  line  in  order  to  help  it  sink

towards the bottom.

lingling-o:  a  kind  of  knobbed  earring  made  of  jadeite,  glass,  or  metal
and  typical  of  Sa  Huynh  in  Vietnam.  It  is  also  found  in  the  neigh-
boring islands and was possibly traded in Southeast Asia.

lip:  the  part  of  a  vessel  most  distant  from  its  base  as  measured  along
the center of the vessel walls, or the portion of the vessel that would
touch the surface on which the vessel rested upside-down (or oriﬁce
down).

lithic,  Lithic:  pertaining  to  or  describing  a  stone  tool  or  artifact.  The
capitalized  term  describes  the  ﬁrst  developmental  period  in  New
World chronology, preceding the Archaic period and characterized by
the use of ﬂaked stone tools and hunting and gathering subsistence.
The combining form means relating to or characteristic of a (speciﬁed)
stage in humankind’s use of stone as a cultural tool and to form the
names of cultural phases, e.g., Neolithic, Mesolithic. Lithics is the pro-
cess or industry of making stone tools and artifacts. [-lithic, lithics]

lithic analysis: the analysis of stone tools and stone tool technology.
lithic experimentation: experimenting with the manufacture of stone tools;
a useful analytical approach to the interpretation of prehistoric artifacts.
lithic  scatter:  a  common  class  of  sites  where  tools  were  made  or
repaired, resulting in a large number of ﬂakes (and typically few other
artifacts) at a site.

lithofacies:  a  part  of  a  sediment  or  rock  that  is  different  in  composi-
tion or character, such as grain size. Characteristics of sediment are
closely  related  to  their  depositional  environment.  Lithofacies  is  a 
lateral, mappable subdivision of a designated stratigraphic unit, dis-

LOCK  RING

181

tinguished from adjacent subdivisions on the basis of lithology – or a
facies (appearance and characteristics of a rock) characterized by par-
ticular lithologic features.

lithophone:  naturally  occurring  stones,  often  stalactites  or  stalagmites,
that were struck to make music as early as Paleolithic times. The set
of struck sonorous stones (individually called phonoliths) have been
found from the South Seas and South America to Africa and the Far
East.  Large  stones  were  used  in  some  Vietnamese  religious  temples 
and  one  of  the  oldest  surviving  lithophones  was  discovered  there.
Remains  of  other  ancient  stones  come  from  Chinese  archaeological
digs,  and  such  instruments  are  mentioned  in  sources  as  early  as  the
Zhou/Chou dynasty (c. 1122–256/255 bc). [phonoliths, stone chimes]
livre de beurre blade: distinctive blade cores of Grand Pressigny (France)

ﬂint which are yellow and resemble slabs of butter.

Liyu:  a  village  near  Hunyan  in  northern  Shanxi,  China,  where  a  large
hoard of bronzes of the 6th and 5th centuries bc was found. The name
Liyu has since been applied to a style of decoration shared by many
bronzes from the hoard and characterized by an interlace of dragons
whose ribbon-like bodies are textured with ﬁne meander and volute
patterns. Its borrowings from steppe art are common to much Chinese
art of the period.

lobate: a type of stem that describes points and knives with curved or

rounded ears.

lobbed:  a  term  used  to  describe  the  base  portion  of  a  point  or  blade 
that is eared. The ears are rounded and are formed by the meeting of
two  circles  creating  a  lobbed  effect.  An  object  with  an  oval-shaped
base or stem.

local  sequence:  a  chronological  series  of  components  or  phases  within

the geographic limits of a locality.

Loch  Lomond  stadial:  a  widespread  but  short  interval  of  renewed
glacial activity and cold climatic conditions in the British Isles. This
event occurred about 11,000 years ago, some 2000 years before the
dissipation of the ice sheet. It is a stadial of the Devensian cold stage
during which small glaciers were formed in the high mountains of Wales
and  the  Lake  District  and  an  icecap  was  formed  over  the  highlands
of  Scotland.  The  Loch  Lomond  stadial  may  be  correlated  with
Godwin’s Pollen Zone III and the Younger Dryas (Scandinavia).

lock:  a  mechanism  for  keeping  a  door,  lid,  or  container  fastened, 

typically operated by a key.

lock  ring:  small  penannular  (almost  complete  ring)  ornament  of  gold 
or  bronze  popular  in  the  Early  to  Middle  Bronze  Age  in  northern
Europe.  They  are  thought  to  have  been  used  as  hair  ornaments.

LOCULUS

loculus: in Roman antiquity, a small chamber or cell in an ancient tomb

for the reception of a body or urn. It was generally made of stone.

London ware: a type of pottery with a burnished gray or black fabric,
often  decorated  with  inscribed  lines,  impressed  stamps,  rouletting, 
and  compass-scribed  circles.  It  was  made  in  the  Thames  Estuary 
area, Suffolk, Hertfordshire, and the Nene Valley in the late 1st and
2nd centuries ad.

loom:  a  device  used  for  weaving  cloth.  Normally  the  variety  of  loom
used can be deduced from surviving fragments of the resulting cloth.
The cloth shows, for example, that the horizontal loom was the more
usual in ancient Egypt, and the vertical loom in Syria and Mesopotamia.
In Europe, the vertical loom with weighted warps was standard. The
weights – disk-shaped, quoit-shaped, or pyramidal – are frequently found
on sites from the Late Neolithic to the Bronze Age and reappear with
the Anglo-Saxons. In the Americas, the most common form was the
belt  or  backstrap  loom,  in  which  a  continuous  warp  thread  passed
between two horizontal poles. One was attached to a support while
the  other  was  attached  to  the  seated  weaver,  who  could  adjust  the
tension  of  the  warps  simply  by  leaning  forward  or  backward.  The 
earliest evidence of the use of the loom, 4400 bc, is a representation
of  a  horizontal  two-bar  (or  two-beamed,  i.e.,  warp  beam  and  cloth
beam) loom pictured on a pottery dish found at al-Badari, Egypt. Loom
weights have been found at archaeological sites dating from 3000 bc,
but  this  type  of  loom  may  have  originated  even  earlier.  By  about
2500 bc,  a  more  advanced  loom  was  apparently  evolving  in  East 
Asia.

loom weight: a perforated stone or ceramic block used for stretching the

threads forming the warp or the weft on a loom. [loomweight]

looped handle: small, sharply curving handles that are ﬁxed to the body

of a vessel without being countersunk.

looped spearhead: a bronze spearhead of the Middle Bronze Age of Europe,
with a pair of small loops cast into the outside of the hafting socket
near the base.

lorica  hamata:  a  type  of  body  armor  worn  by  Roman  legions:  a  shirt

made of iron chain mail.

lorica segmentata: a type of body armor worn by Roman legions: a cuirass

made from iron strips hinged together.

lorica squamata: a type of body armor worn by Roman legions: a cuirass

made from shaped scales of iron and bronze riveted together.

lost wax casting: a method of casting metals in which the desired form
is carved in wax, coated with clay and baked; the wax runs out through
vents left in the clay for the purpose, and molten metal is then poured
through  the  same  vents  into  the  mold.  When  the  metal  is  cool,  the

LUCERNA

183

clay is broken off to reveal the metal casting. Each mold can only be
used  once.  The  technique  was  ﬁrst  developed  in  the  4th  millennium
bc in the Near East, especially by the Shang bronzeworkers of China.
It  was  also  used  for  gold  in  South  America  and  Mesoamerica.  The
method  was  used  for  casting  complex  forms,  such  as  statuary.  [cire
perdue, lost wax, lost wax casting technique, lost wax process]

lot: any unit of collection in which artifacts are presumed to share the

same particular context, typically a level of a trench.

lot  number:  the  number  assigned  to  an  archaeological  collection  that
identiﬁes an aspect of context within a collection; part of the catalog
number.

loutrophoros: in Greek antiquity, a container with a slender ovoid body,
long neck, ﬂaring mouth, and two long handles. They were used from
the 6th century bc for ritual purposes at weddings and funerals. The
shape also appears in relief or in the round on Attic grave stelae.

loving cup: a two-handled cup passed round at banquets.
low side notched: a ﬂaking technique applied to accommodate hafting
which involved the ﬂaking of notches into the side of a preform near
its base.

Lower Paleolithic: the earliest part of the Paleolithic period, beginning
about 2.5 million years ago and lasting to about 100,000 years ago.
It was characterized by the ﬁrst use of crude stone tools, the practice
of hunting and gathering, and the development of social units, settle-
ments, and structures. It was the era of the earliest forms of humans.
The phases of the Paleolithic have been subdivided based on artifact
typology; the Lower Paleolithic is the period of early hominid pebble
tool  and  core  tool  manufacture.  In  China,  the  Early  Paleolithic  ran
from 1,000,000 to 73,000 bc.

Luangwa pottery: a Late Iron Age complex of central, eastern, and north-
ern Zambia in the 2nd millennium ad with a distinctive pottery style.
It appeared as a break from the Chifumbaze complex in the 11th cen-
tury,  originated  in  Zaire,  and  has  continued  into  Recent  times.  The
term (also Luangwa variant) is also used for Earlier Stone Age Sangoan
collections from eastern Zambia. This facies of the Sangoan industry
is  found  in  gravel  deposits  of  the  Luangwa  and  tributary  valleys  of
eastern  Zambia,  and  is  marked  by  large  picks  and  other  core  tools
made from water-rounded cobbles.

Lucanian  pottery:  red-ﬁgured  pottery  made  in  Lucania  from  the  late 
5th  century  through  to  the  4th  century  bc.  There  are  links  with 
Apulian pottery.

lucerna: an oil lamp or lantern of terra cotta or bronze. One side had
a  handle,  the  other  had  one  or  more  places  for  wicks.  The  oil  was
poured in through an opening in the center.

184

LUG

lug: an ear-shaped protuberance, sometimes ﬂattened, added to the wall
of a pot to assist in holding it. It may or may not be perforated. The
hole was designed to take a cord or thong only and it was not a true
handle.

lunate:  a  crescent-  or  half-moon-shaped  ﬂint  with  the  inner  edge
untrimmed and the thick, rounded edge having small chips removed.
It was used as an arrowhead.

lunula:  a  crescent-shaped  sheet  of  gold,  probably  worn  as  a  collar  or
chest  ornament  in  the  Early  Bronze  Age,  possibly  for  rituals.  Their
incised  geometric  decorations  are  similar  to  those  on  bell  beakers. 
They originated with the Food Vessel people of Ireland, Scotland, and
perhaps Wales in the Early Bronze Age, and were traded not only to
southern England but also across to northern Europe. The decoration
has led to the suggestion that it imitates the multiple-strand necklaces
of  jet  and  amber  that  are  also  found  during  the  Early  Bronze  Age.
[lunulae (pl.)]

Lupemban: a stone industry of the Lower Paleolithic of west-central Africa,
developed from a Sangoan predecessor and characterized by tools appro-
priate  for  rough  woodwork.  Lupemban  industry  has  been  found  in
northern  Angola  and  southern  Zaire  and  an  important  dated  site  is
at  Kalambo  Falls  on  the  Zambia–Tanzania  border.  In  contrast  with
the Sangoan, Lupemban assemblages are marked by the ﬁne quality
of  their  bifacial  stoneworking  technique  on  elongated  double-ended
points,  large  side  scrapers,  and  thick  core-axes.  The  industry  spans
from before 30,000 bc until c. 15,000 bc. [Lupembian]

lur:  a  Late  Bronze  Age,  large  bronze  musical  horn  or  trumpet,  having 
a double curve and a disk-shaped, permanent mouth. The long curv-
ing  tube  was  cast  in  sections  by  the  lost  wax  (cire  perdue)  method
that ﬁtted together, ending in a ﬂat metal disk decorated with raised
embossing.  Lurer  come  from  the  peat  bogs  of  Scandinavia  and  are
almost always found in pairs, suggesting that they were votive offer-
ings. Lurer are among the most elaborate products of the European
bronzesmiths; experiments have shown that they have a surprisingly
large musical range. [lure; lurer (pl.)]

Luristan bronze: any of the horse trappings, utensils, weapons, jewelry,
belt buckles, and ritual and votive objects of bronze probably dating
from roughly 2600 to 600 bc that have been excavated in the Harsin,
Khorramabad, and Alishtar Valleys of the Zagros Mountains in the
Lorestan region of western Iran, especially at the site of Tepe Sialk.
Their  precise  origin  is  unknown.  Scholars  believe  that  they  were 
created  either  by  the  Cimmerians,  a  nomadic  people  from  southern
Russia who may have invaded Iran in the 8th century bc, or by such
related Indo-European peoples as the early Medes and Persians. The

LYON  WARE

185

term denotes a broad region of this metalwork and therefore has little
cultural historical meaning. [Lorestan]

luster: a gentle sheen or soft glow, especially that of a partly reﬂective

lusterware: pottery decorated by applying metallic compounds to the glaze
which become iridescent metallic ﬁlms during ﬁring. [luster pottery]
lute: to join together two leather-hard pieces of a vessel by using slip as

surface.

a glue.

lydion:  in  Greek  antiquity,  a  type  of  pot  for  perfumes.  Numerous 

examples have been found in Lydia, western Turkey, and Athens.

Lyles Hill ware: a type of Early and Middle Neolithic pottery found in
the northeast of England, named after the site of Hanging Grimston
in  what  was  formerly  the  East  Riding  of  Yorkshire.  It  is  character-
ized  by  ﬁne  fabrics,  good-quality  ﬁnish,  and  round-bottomed  forms
with a carinated proﬁle. In 1974 Isobel Smith suggested that such pots
were part of a far wider distribution of carinated vessels found right
across the British Isles and she proposed the term Grimston-Lyles Hill
ware. These vessels represent the earliest style of pottery found in the
British Neolithic, although the term shouldered bowl is now preferred
to Grimston-Lyles Hill. [Grimston ware]

Lyngby: a site in Jutland, Denmark, which has given its name to a kind
of  small  bone  implement  (ax)  made  of  antler  stem  and  branch  and
beveled  to  form  a  sharp  edge.  The  tools  date  to  c.  9000–8000 bc.
[Lyngby ax, Lyngby axe, Lyngby tools]

Lyon  ware:  ﬁne  colored  cups  and  beakers  with  roughcast  appliqué 
or rusticated decoration from Lyon, France from c. ad 43 through to
c. ad 70.

M

macaroni style: in art, Late Paleolithic ﬁnger tracings in clay, the oldest
form  of  art  known.  Innumerable  examples  appear  on  the  walls  and
ceilings of limestone caves associated with human habitation in France
(Pech Merle) and Spain, the oldest dating from about 30,000 bc. They
range from simple scratchings and jumbled lines to deliberate meanders
and  arabesques  and  outline  drawings  of  animals  and  are  so-called
because  they  look  like  pieces  of  macaroni.  It  is  thought  that  these 
macaroni, like the numerous foot and handprints pressed into the clay
of the caves, were inspired by animal tracks. [macaroni]

mace:  a  small  club-like  weapon,  usually  of  stone,  crafted  to  ﬁt  snugly
in  the  hand,  for  pounding.  It  often  had  a  perforated  head  and  was
attached  to  a  shaft  of  wood  (or  ivory  or  horn),  often  tapering
towards  the  end  that  was  gripped.  Many  maceheads  have  been 
excavated from Predynastic and Early Dynastic cemeteries in Egypt.
In medieval times, it was made of iron and used for breaking defen-
sive armor.

macehead: the stone or metal top of a mace, usually perforated.
macroblade: a large blade, greater than 5 cm (2 inches) in length.
macrofauna: large animals. [see microfauna]
macrolith: any large stone tool. [see microlith]
magatama:  term  meaning  curved  bead/jewel,  or  a  jade  or  jasper 
pendant  made  since  the  Neolithic  but  especially  during  the  Jomon,
Yayoi,  and  Kofun  periods.  These  comma-shaped  beads  (with  a  per-
foration at the thick end) have been found in 4th to 7th century ad
tombs  in  Korea  and  Japan.  They  purportedly  had  magic  properties.
In the Tumulus/Kofun period (3rd to 6th centuries) of Japan, it was
an imperial emblem. Many of these beads decorated the gold crowns
of  Silla  (Korea).  Its  form  may  derive  from  prehistoric  animal-tooth
pendants. [kogok]

MAGIC  BRICK

187

Magdalenian: the ﬁnal major European culture of the Upper Paleolithic
period, from about 15,000 to 10,000 years ago; characterized by com-
posite or specialized tools, tailored clothing, and, especially, geomet-
ric  and  representational  cave  art  (e.g.,  Altamira)  and  for  beautiful
decorative work in bone and ivory (mobiliary art). The people were
chieﬂy ﬁshermen and reindeer hunters; they were the ﬁrst known people
to have used a spear thrower (of reindeer bone and antler) to increase
range, strength, and accuracy. Magdalenian stone tools include small
geometrically shaped implements (e.g., triangles, semilunar blades) prob-
ably set into bone or antler handles for use, burins (a sort of chisel),
scrapers, borers, backed bladelets, and shouldered and leaf-shaped pro-
jectile points. Bone was used extensively to make wedges, adzes, ham-
mers, spearheads with link shafts, barbed points and harpoons, eyed
needles, jewelry, and hooked rods (probably used as spear throwers).
They killed animals with spears, snares, and traps and lived in caves,
rock shelters, or substantial dwellings in winter and in tents in sum-
mer. The name is derived from La Madeleine or Magdalene, the type
site  in  the  Dordogne  of  southwest  France.  The  culture’s  center  of 
origin  was  southwest  France  and  the  adjacent  parts  of  Spain,  but 
elements  characteristic  of  the  later  stages  are  represented  in  Britain
(Creswell Crags), and eastwards to southwest Germany and Poland.
The Magdalenian culture, like that of earlier Upper Paleolithic com-
munities, was adapted to the cold conditions of the last (Würm) glacia-
tion. The Magdalenian has been divided into six phases; it followed
the  Solutrean  industry  and  was  succeeded  by  the  simpliﬁed  Azilian.
Magdalenian  culture  disappeared  as  the  cool,  near-glacial  climate
warmed at the end of the fourth (Würm) glacial period (c. 10,000 bc),
and herd animals became scarce. [Age of the Reindeer]

Magellan periods: a chronological sequence covering 8000 bc to ad 1000,
constructed on the basis of assemblages from Fell’s Cave and the Palli
Aike Cave in Patagonia, South America. The sequence is divided into
ﬁve phases, describing a series of hunting and marine adaptations. The
earliest  assemblage  (Magellan  I)  contains  ﬁshtail  projectile  points, 
signifying Paleoindian activity. Horse and sloth bones and the remains
of  three  partly  cremated  Dolichocephalic  humans,  found  in  associ-
ation with these points, have produced a single radiocarbon date of 
c.  8700 bc.  A  shift  to  willowleaf  points  occurred  in  Magellan  II 
c. 8000–4000 bc, which coincides with the disappearance of Pleistocene
megafauna  and  widespread  climatic  change.  Magellan  IV–V  are  ill-
deﬁned  but  represent  a  continuing  hunting  strategy  blending  into  a
period of ceramic use.

magic  brick:  a  set  of  four  mud  bricks  that  were  often  placed  on  the 
four sides of an Egyptian tomb during the New Kingdom, c. 1550–
1069 bc, in order to protect the deceased from evil.

188

MAGMA

magma: hot ﬂuid or semiﬂuid material within the Earth’s crust from which

lava and other igneous rock is formed by cooling.

magnetite: a strongly magnetic form of iron ore, a major constituent of
magnetitite and a common accessory mineral in igneous rocks. In the
Mesoamerican region, magnetite was commonly mined and polished
to make mirrors and compasses. It frequently has distinct north and
south poles, and has been known for this property at least since 500 bc.

mail armor: armor made up of interlaced metal rings.
majolica: tin-glazed earthenware; a distinctive kind of colorful, decorated
earthenware that is tin enameled and glazed – usually of Italian, Spanish,
or Mexican origin. This earthenware was introduced by Moorish pot-
ters  from  the  island  of  Majorca  in  the  15th  century.  Distinguishing
features of majolica ware are coarseness of ware, intricacy of pattern,
and occasionally prismatic glaze. It is made of potter’s clay mixed with
marl and sand, and is soft or hard according to the nature of the com-
position and the degree of heat under which it is ﬁred in the kiln. Soft
wares  are  either  unglazed  or  lustrous,  or  glazed,  or  enameled.  The
majolica painter’s palette was usually restricted to ﬁve colors: cobalt
blue,  antimony  yellow,  iron  red,  copper  green,  and  manganese  pur-
ple; the purple and blue were used, at various periods, mainly for out-
line. A white tin enamel was used also for highlights or alone on the
white  tin  glaze  in  what  was  called  bianco  sopra  bianco,  “white  on
white.” The Italian lustrous ware is properly majolican and originated
in  Faenza,  Deruta,  Urbino,  Orvieto,  Gubbio,  Florence,  and  Savona.
[delft, faience, maiolica]

maker’s  mark:  a  manufacturing  mark  etched  or  stamped  on  mass-

produced ceramics, glassware, or metal. [hallmark]

malachite: a minor ore but a widespread mineral of copper; basic copper
carbonate, green in color. It was ﬁrst employed as a cosmetic and oint-
ment for the eyes, to cut down the glare of the sun, and discourage ﬂies.
The discovery that metal could be obtained from it was probably accid-
ental and then it was used as a source of copper. The extensive deposits
in  Sinai  were  much  exploited  in  antiquity.  It  was  also  used  for  oils
and watercolors and was encrusted upon other materials as ornament.
Malvernian ware: a pottery industry of west central England, c. Middle
Bronze Age, but from the mid 1st millennium bc onward very coarse,
handmade jars were added.

Mamóm:  a  type  of  pottery  made  in  lowland  Maya  villages  in  Late
Formative (Late Pre-Classic) times, usually monochrome with a waxy
surface, with many ﬂat-bottomed bowls.

manacle: a shackle for the hand.
Mangaasi  pottery:  a  long-lived  pottery  tradition  of  central  Vanuatu,
Melanesia, dated to between c. 700 bc and ad 1600. It had incised

MARL

189

Mano

and applied relief and was quite different from the ancestral Polynesian
Lapita pottery. It was a Melanesian tradition, with parallels in the north-
ern Solomons and New Caledonia.

mano: a one- or two-handled, small and ﬂat ground stone tool used with
a metate (quern) for grinding vegetable material such as maize, seeds,
nuts, pigments, etc. Manos date to the Archaic Indian period, the word
coming  from  the  Spanish  mano  de  piedra,  “hand  stone”  –  referring
to the upper stone which is usually cylindrical or ovoid in shape. The
underlying smooth stone slab is the metate. It is a hallmark artifact,
deﬁning the economic or subsistence base of prehistoric societies. Its
forms  vary  considerably,  from  a  barely  modiﬁed  cobble  to  a  long 
cylinder similar to a rolling pin. [handstone]

mantelet:  great  wicker  or  wooden  shields,  sometimes  mounted  on

wheels, used in sieges by archers as a protective screen.

manufacture:  the  second  stage  of  the  behavioral  processes  (following 
acquisition,  and  before  use  and  deposition),  in  which  raw  materials
are modiﬁed to produce artifacts.

manuport: any artifact or natural object that is transported, but not nec-
essarily modiﬁed, and deposited by humans. Examples would include
seashells found inland or water-rolled pebbles away from any river.
Marajó Island, Marajoara: a large island at the mouth of the Amazon
River in Brazil with numerous artiﬁcial mound sites. Small ones served
as house platforms and larger ones contain urn burials. The pottery
has  sophisticated  polychrome  designs  and  is  similar  to  that  of  pre-
Columbian  Andean  cultures.  Radiocarbon  dates  suggest  that  the
Marajoara style began no later than the 5th century ad and lasted until
ad 1300. The largest center, Os Camutins, has 40 mounds. It is the
world’s largest ﬂuvial island (one produced by sediments deposited by
a stream or river) and half of it is ﬂooded during the rainy season. [Marajó]
marble: metamorphic rock composed wholly or in large part of calcite
or dolomite crystals, the crystalline texture being the result of meta-
morphism of limestone by heat and pressure. The term marble is loosely
applied to any limestone or dolomite that takes a good polish and is
otherwise suitable as a building stone or ornamental stone.

marbled ware: pottery patterned with veins or streaks or color resembl-

ing marble.

Marcavalle: an Early Horizon period pottery style of Cuzco, Peru, over-
lapping with and from which the Chanapata style derived, c. 1200 bc.

margin: the edge of a stone tool or ﬂake.
mark: any drawing, painting, engraving, or other modiﬁcation of nature

that is the product of some human action.

marl: a calcareous clay; a mixture of clay and particles of calcite, dolomite,

and/or shell.

190

MAROS  POINT

Maros point: small, hollow-based, stone projectile points, often with ser-
rated  edge  retouch,  and  characteristic  of  a  mature  phase  of  the
Toalian industry of southwestern Sulawesi, India, from c. 6000 bc into
the 1st millennium bc. They were part of a mid-Holocene stone ﬂake
and blade industry.

Mary Rose: a Tudor warship, the ﬂagship of Henry VIII’s ﬂeet, which
sank in Portsmouth harbor, off the south coast of England, on its maiden
voyage in 1545. The exploration, excavation, and recovery of the ship
is the largest underwater archaeology project ever undertaken. By the
time the ship was raised in October 1982, the project had already cost
US$4 million. The Mary Rose excavation has yielded remarkable infor-
mation about Tudor military and daily life. It has also provided the
opportunity  for  the  development  of  new  equipment  and  techniques
for underwater archaeology.

mask: an object worn, or carried, to cover the face.
massebah: a standing stone or group of stones in the Levant similar to
a dolmen. There was probably a cult purpose when they were erected
by the Canaanites (as at Gezer, Hazor). When set up by the Israelites,
it was likely commemorative.

mastos: a breast-shaped drinking cup, usually with one horizontal and
one  vertical  handle.  In  Athens,  black-glossed  and  ﬁgured  decorated
examples have been found.

mataa: large-stemmed obsidian spearpoint that was shaped and hafted
by inhabitants of Easter Island, from the period of internal wars, 18th
to 19th centuries ad.

matchlock: a device for igniting gunpowder in ﬁrearms, developed in the
15th century, that was a major advance in the manufacture of small
arms.  The  matchlock  was  the  ﬁrst  mechanical  ﬁring  device.  It  con-
sisted of a type of musket that used an attached burning taper to light
the  gunpowder.  A  match  would  ﬁre  the  priming  powder  in  the  pan
attached to the side of the barrel. The ﬂash in the pan penetrated a
small port in the breech of the gun and ignited the main charge.

Matera  ware:  a  Middle  Neolithic  ware  from  many  sites  in  the  neigh-
borhood of Matera, northwest of Taranto, and a cave site, the Grotta
dei  Pipistrelli,  Italy.  A  dark  burnished  ware  with  curved  bowls  and
straight-necked  jars,  it  is  characterized  by  rectilinear  geometric
designs scratched after ﬁring and ﬁlled with an inlay of red ocher. A
quite  different  ware,  thin,  buff-colored,  and  painted  with  broad
bands of scarlet, is sometimes included in the term.

material:  substance  of  which  an  artifact  is  made,  such  as  bone,  obsid-

ian, jade, etc.

material culture: the artifacts and ecofacts used by a group to cope with
their  physical  and  social  environment.  Material  culture  includes  the

MEAN  CERAMIC  DATING  FORMULA

191

buildings,  tools,  and  other  artifacts  that  constitute  the  material
remains of a former society – its technology and artifacts combined.
Material  culture  thus  embraces  folk  architecture,  folk  arts,  and  folk
crafts. For example, the construction of houses, the design and decora-
tion  of  buildings  and  utensils,  and  the  performance  of  home  indus-
tries, according to traditional styles and methods, make up material
culture. The distinction is made between those aspects of culture that
appear as physical objects, and those aspects that are nonmaterial. It
is the major source of evidence for archaeology.

matrix: the soil or physical material in which an excavation is conducted,
or  within  which  artifacts  or  fossils  are  embedded  or  supported;  the
surrounding  deposit  in  which  archaeological  ﬁnds  are  situated.
Originally the term described the grains in sediments or rocks that are
ﬁner than the coarsest material in the sediment or rock.

matting:  the  method  of  incising  a  cross-hatched  pattern  on  metal  to 

create a dull area.

the handle.

mattock:  a  tool  used  for  digging  where  the  blade  is  at  right  angles  to

matt-painted pottery: Middle Helladic pottery with simple decoration in
manganese-based purple-black paint on a pale ground. Matt-painted
pottery has been found in the nearer islands to mainland Greece and
even as far as Crete and the Anatolian coast.

maturity:  range  of  temperature  and  time  (maturing  range)  at  which  a
clay body ﬁres to desired qualities of hardness, porosity, and service-
ability; the temperature and time at which a glaze develops qualities
of bonding (to the body), stability, strength, and texture.

maul: a heavy, massive, long-handled hammer dating to the Archaic Indian

period.

Mazapan ware: a ceramic style developing out of Coyotlatelco and ﬁrst
appearing in association with major architecture at Tula, Mexico in
the Post-Classic Toltec phase (9th to 12th century ad). The orange-
on-buff  (or  red-on-buff)  pottery  was  decorated  by  straight  or  wavy
parallel lines produced by multiple brushes.

mazer: a drinking bowl, often wooden.
McKean point: the bifacially worked chipped stone projectile points of
the McKean complex of the Middle Archaic stage in the Great Plains
of  North  America,  c.  2900–1000 bc.  They  are  lanceolate  in  outline
with curved sides and a hollow base.

meadowood  point:  a  triangular  side-notched  point,  with  notches
chipped into each side of the base to form a stem below the main part
of the arrowhead point, generally 6 cm (2.5 inches) long.

mean ceramic dating formula: a statistical technique devised for pooling
the median age of manufacture for temporally signiﬁcant pottery types.

MEANDER

meander: any running design consisting of a single line or regular band
twisting. The spiral meander is a simple running spiral, the square mean-
der is a rectilinear form of the same thing. The earliest known exam-
ples  of  ﬁnger  painting  are  the  prehistoric  decorative  and  ﬁgurative
meanders traced on walls of the Altamira caves in Spain.

medal:  a  piece  of  metal,  usually  in  the  form  of  a  disk,  struck  or  cast
with an inscription or device to commemorate an event, or awarded
as a mark of distinction.

medallion: a large medal.
medial: middle portion of an artifact or faunal element.
medial axis: the middle of an imaginary line about which a body rotates

or with respect to which it possesses rotational symmetry.

median historic date: intermediate age of occupation for a known-age site.
median  ridge:  a  ridge  that  usually  runs  from  the  tip  of  a  blade  to  the
hafting area which was formed by collateral ﬂaking techniques in the
manufacture of the artifact. The median ridge can be the thickest part
of the blade.

medithermal:  the  last  of  the  divisions  of  the  Neothermal  (postglacial)

period, dating from about 4000 years ago to the present.

megalithic  art:  Neolithic  engravings  found  on  megalithic  stones  of
chambered  tombs  and  menhirs.  Motifs  include  the  concrete  and  the
abstract.  The  art  is  associated  with  passage  graves;  examples  are
Gavrinis, Knowth, and Newgrange. Megalithic art objects often sug-
gest a highly developed cult of a spirit world connected with the remains
of the dead. [stone art]

Megarian bowl: a handleless hemispherical Greek drinking cup made in
molds and often decorated in relief and ﬁnished in the black-glossed
technique. Widespread in the Hellenistic period from the 3rd century
bc, they developed into the red-glossed Arrentine wares. The type was
ﬁrst recognized at Megara and they were made until the 1st century
ad. They were imitations of gold and silver vessels and served as the
ﬁrst form of book illustration. They often bear on their exteriors scenes
in relief from literary texts that are sometimes accompanied by Greek
quotations. They likely served as models for Roman artists who created
the ﬁrst true book illustrations.

Meillacoid  phase:  one  of  two  ceramic  series  (the  other  being  the
Chicoid) that emerged from the Ostinoid series. Originating in Haiti,
it remained largely conﬁned to the western Greater Antilles. Sites are
usually village shell middens, but are often close to good agricultural
land. The characteristic pottery is thin and hard but with a rough sur-
face texture and simple incision, sometimes combined with appliquéd
strips. The dates are usually within ad 850–1000, although some sites
in central Cuba endured to as late as 1500. [Melliac]

Meipin:  Japanese  name  for  a  type  of  bottle  with  a  narrow  neck,  high
shoulders, and pinched-in base. Meipin were originally a Chinese cre-
ation, popular in the Sung, Yuan, and Ming periods and the beginning
of the T’sing period. The shape spread to Korea (Koryo celadons) and
to Japan. Some were made in the kilns. [Meiping (Chinese)]

menhir:  a  single,  vertical  standing  stone;  any  prehistoric  structure 
consisting of a tall, upright megalith (“huge stone”). The name is from
the  Old  Breton  men,  meaning  “stone,”  and  hir,  meaning  “long.”
Menhirs occur in all parts of the world where megalithic monuments
are  known,  but  they  are  particularly  profuse  in  prehistoric  Europe.
Menhirs are difﬁcult to date, but in Ireland and southwest England a
few examples mark burials dating from the Neolithic to the Middle
or  Late  Bronze  Age.  A  similar  or  slightly  earlier  date  is  attested  for
some  of  the  Breton  menhirs.  In  all  these  areas,  a  few  of  the  stones
bear cup marks. Such a megalith is often isolated, erected by a family
or  tribe  as  a  memorial  stone  for  some  deceased  hero  or  some  great
event. It may have been a religious object for worship like the American
Indian  totem  pole.  Other  are  associated  with  dolmens,  tumuli,  and
circles of stones. Menhirs may occur singly, in rows (alignments), or
in  enclosures  (stone  circles).  Anthropomorphic  examples  are  known
as statue-menhirs.

merchant’s  hoard:  any  collection  of  Bronze  Age  metalwork  deposited
together, possibly either for ceremonial reasons or to hide it in times
of danger, consisting of new or recently manufactured objects ready
to be traded.

mesial: to or directed towards the midline of a body.
Mesolithic:  a  time  period  in  human  history  beginning  with  the  retreat
of glacial ice c. 8500 bc and the changing climatic conditions follow-
ing it; a development in northwestern Europe that lasted until about
2700 bc. This Middle Stone Age followed the Upper Paleolithic and
preceded  the  Neolithic.  It  was  a  period  of  transition  in  the  Early
Holocene between the hunter-gatherer existence and the development
of farming and pottery production. Glacial ﬂora and fauna were replaced
by  modern  forms  and  the  ﬂint  industries  are  often  distinguished  by
an abundance of microliths. The equipment was designed for ﬁshing
and  fowling  as  well  as  hunting  and  often  included  many  tiny  ﬂints,
or microliths, that were set in wooden shafts and hafts, and stone axes
or adzes used for woodworking. Forests grew in Europe and people
modiﬁed their lives accordingly. In the Near East, which remained free
of ice sheets, climatic change was less signiﬁcant than in northern Europe
and agriculture was practiced soon after the close of the Pleistocene.
In this area the Mesolithic period was short and poorly differentiated.
In Britain the Mesolithic–Neolithic transition did not come until around

Mesolithic microlith

MESOLITHIC

4000 bc. The dog was domesticated during the Mesolithic. The term
is used widely only in European prehistory.

Mesozoic:  the  second  of  the  Earth’s  three  major  geological  eras  of
Phanerozoic time and the interval during which the continental land-
masses  as  known  today  were  separated  from  the  supercontinents
Laurasia  (North  America  and  Eurasia)  and  Gondwana  by  continen-
tal  drift.  It  occurred  before  the  Cenozoic  and  after  the  Paleozoic, 
and  was  marked  by  the  development  of  the  ancestors  of  the  major
plant  and  animal  groups  that  exist  today  and  the  extinction  of  the
dinosaur, suddenly, at the end of the Cretaceous period. It lasted from
about 245 to 66.4 million years ago and included, in order, the Triassic,
Jurassic, and Cretaceous.

metal artifact: any artifact made from metal, including copper, bronze,
iron,  gold,  silver,  tin,  and  lead.  They  were  commonly  used  as  con-
stituents of alloys.

metallographic microscopy: microscopic examination of metal artifacts
with the aim of studying their manufacturing techniques rather than
their  composition.  A  sample  is  taken  from  the  artifact,  preferably 
a  cross-sectional  slice,  and  is  highly  polished.  The  surface  is  then 
etched in order to dissolve some of the metal, leaving visible its inter-
nal structure for examination under a metallurgical microscope. This
uses reﬂected light which emphasizes the uneven surfaces revealed by
the  etching  process  and  caused  by  such  features  as  the  boundaries
between grains of metal. The size and shape of the grains or dendrites
in  a  metal  (crystalline  structure),  as  well  as  other  details  of  micro-
structure,  can  yield  information  on  casting  methods  or  post-casting
working. The technique can be used on both ferrous and nonferrous
metals. [metallographic examination]

metallurgical analysis: the study of metals; metal artifacts and the tools
or waste products of their manufacture are examined to reconstruct
manufacturing processes, the source of raw materials, and the usage.
This may be done by the various techniques of chemical analysis, or
may involve metallographic examination under a microscope. In the
case of copper, bronze, and other nonferrous metals, such analysis may
yield information about alloys, casting, cold working, and annealing.
For iron and steel, there may be information about forging, carbur-
ization, quenching, and tempering.

metamorphic rock: rocks that have been changed from their original form
by heat or by pressure beneath the Earth’s surface. Metamorphic trans-
formations  include  limestone  to  marble,  shale  to  slate,  and  slate  to
schist. When magma forms an intrusion, it heats and alters the sur-
rounding rocks by contact metamorphism, which forms a ring of altered
rocks – the metamorphic aureole – around the intrusion.

MICROBURIN

Mano

Metate

metate: a ground-stone slab with a concave upper surface used as a lower
millstone  against  which  another  stone  is  rubbed  to  grind  vegetable 
material such as cereal grains, seeds, nuts, etc. A metate is one of a
two-part milling apparatus – the other part being a mano (handheld
upper grindstone). Metates are found in agricultural and pre-agricultural
contexts over much of the world and are often made of volcanic rock
in Mesoamerica. It is a Spanish term for a smoothed, usually immobile,
stone with a concave upper surface and is mostly associated with the
grinding of maize. It is a hallmark artifact in the deﬁnition of prehis-
toric  subsistence  patterns.  [concave  quern,  grinding  platform,  lower
grindstone, stone saddle quern]

metope: in architecture, the space between two triglyphs of a Doric frieze,
often adorned with carved work. The entablature or frieze in build-
ings using the Classical Doric order is usually composed of alternate
triglyphs (projecting rectangular blocks, each ornamented with three
vertical channels) and metopes (spaces).

mica: a mineral that occurs in a glittering, scaly form, widely prized for

ornament.

mica-dusted pottery: pottery coated with a slip containing mica particles

to give a golden or bronze sheen. [mica-gilt pottery]

Micoquian:  ﬁnal  Acheulian  phase  deﬁned  on  the  basis  of  assemblages
from La Micoque, near Les Eyzies, France. Sites are found in central
Europe, including some in the former Soviet Union. The characteris-
tic  artifact  is  a  pointed  pyriform  (pear-shaped)  or  lanceolate  (taper-
ing) biface with a well-made tip.

microblade:  a  small,  narrow  stone  blade,  ranging  from  less  than  5  to
11 mm (0.1–0.4 inches) wide and about 15–45 mm (0.6–1.7 inches)
long. They were often made from a conical or wedge-shaped micro-
core,  often  punch-struck  or  pressure-ﬂaked.  Microblades  were  often
retouched into various forms of microliths. Microblades are found in
the Upper Paleolithic industries of Eurasia and in the Upper Paleolithic
of Siberia, but are also characteristic of the Mesolithic and later indus-
tries of the circumpolar regions. Examples are the Eastern Gravettian,
the Dyuktai culture, and the Arctic Small Tool tradition.

microblade core: nucleus from which microblades were manufactured;
usually a small barrel- or conical-shaped stone artifact with a ﬂat top
and one or more ﬂuted surfaces left as scars from the removal of the
microblades.

microburin: a microlith produced by notching and snapping a blade; a
small piece of stone snapped off a microlith which is a byproduct of
the manufacture of microliths. A blade is notched and then snapped
off  where  the  chipping  has  narrowed  and  weakened  it.  One  piece
becomes a microlithic tool, while the residue (the microburin) still shows

196

MICROBURIN

traces  of  the  original  notch  and  fracture.  Certain  trapeze-shaped
microliths were made from the central part of a double-notched blade,
in which case both ends have the appearance of microburins. This pro-
cedure allowed the maker to obtain a strong head with a sharp point
by breaking up ﬂint blades after making a notch in them – a practice
widespread in the Mesolithic as a means of manufacturing arrowheads.
The name originates from the erroneous belief that these pieces were
the same as burins. [microburin technique]

microdenticulate: a small ﬂake or blade with a series of notches along

the edge.

microfauna: small animals, such as rodents and insectivores, as compared
with  macrofauna.  Besides  referring  to  the  small  or  strictly  localized
fauna, as of a microenvironment, the term is applied to minute animals,
especially those invisible to the naked eye.

microﬂake: a tiny scar on the surface of a stone tool that may indicate
the use of a speciﬁc type, such as for cutting or scraping. Microﬂaking
is minute edge ﬂaking that occurs when stone tools are used.

microlith: any of various very small stone tools varying in size from 1
to 5 cm (0.4–2 inches) – mainly thin blades or blade fragments with
sharp cutting edges, usually geometric in shape, and set into a wooden
handle or shaft or the tip of a bone or antler as an arrow point. They
were shaped by abrupt retouch into various shapes like triangles and
crescents. Microliths were produced during the later Upper Paleolithic
and Mesolithic and were either struck as blades from very small cores
or were made from fractured blades using the microburin technique.
They  are  characteristic,  for  example,  of  the  Azilian  culture  of  the
Mesolithic. Microliths represent both a versatile and an economic use
of  raw  material  –  just  as  blades  yield  more  cutting  edge  than  ﬂakes
per unit weight of raw material, so bladelets improve yet further this
advantage, by a factor of something over 100 compared to core tools.
[pigmy stone]

micropolish: any edge or surface abrasion and gloss that increases from
tool  use.  It  is  sometimes  evident  only  when  stone  tools  are  studied
under high-powered microscopes.

microscarring:  minute  patterns  of  edge  damage  on  a  stone  tool,  often

suggesting how that tool was utilized.

microstructure: the arrangement of phases of a material; in a ceramic,
the  internal  arrangement  of  crystalline  and  amorphous  materials,
pores, and boundaries between them.

microwear: patterns of edge damage on a stone tool providing archaeo-
logical evidence of the ways in which that tool was used. Microscopic
scratches  and  polish  on  the  surface  of  stone  tools  or  hominid  teeth
might  reveal  how  various  tools  were  used  or  what  types  of  food 
certain hominids ate. [microscarring]

MIDDLE  HORIZON

microwear analysis: study of the patterns of wear or damage on the edge
of stone tools, which provides valuable information on the way in which
the tool was used.

midden: a refuse deposit resulting from human activities, generally con-
sisting of soil, food remains (bone and shell), and discarded artifacts.
Middle Assyrian: 1. A period in the history of the Assyrian Empire extend-
ing from the 14th to 12th centuries bc. In the Late Bronze Age, Assyria
was dominated by the Mitanni state, but in the 14th century bc, Assyria
became  dominant.  Ashur-uballit  I  created  the  ﬁrst  Assyrian  Empire
and initiated the Middle Assyrian period. With the help of the Hittites,
he  destroyed  the  dominion  of  the  Aryan  Mitanni  (a  non-Semitic 
people from upper Iran and Syria) and ravaged Nineveh. Later, allied
with the Kassite successors in Babylonia, Ashur-uballit ended Hittite
and  Hurrian  rule.  By  intermarriage  he  then  inﬂuenced  the  Kassite
dynasty  and  eventually  dominated  all  of  Babylonia,  thus  paving  the
way for the Neo-Assyrian mastery during the Sargonid dynasty (12th
to 7th century). The succeeding Assyrian kings expanded the empire
through northern Mesopotamia and the mountains to the north and
brieﬂy occupied Babylonia. Several kings weakened Assyria, but then
others  brought  back  its  dominion.  2.  The  name  of  a  form  of  cunei-
form that was used extensively in writing law code and other docu-
ments. Middle Assyrian laws were found on clay tablets at Ashur (at
the time of Tiglath-pileser I, 1114–1076 bc).

Middle  Bronze  Age:  in  the  Levant,  the  period  of  sophisticated  urban 
civilization of the Canaanites, divided into Middle Bronze Age (MBA)
I, c. 1950–1800 bc, and MBA II, c. 1800–1550 bc. The Middle Bronze
Age provides the background for the beginning of the story of the Old
Testament. The archaeological evidence for the period shows new types
of pottery, weapons, and burial practices. It was an urban civilization
based  on  agriculture.  There  was  much  contact  with  the  Phoenicians
and the Egyptians during this time. The destruction of Megiddo, Jericho,
and  Tell  Beit  Mirsim  that  followed  the  Egyptians’  expulsion  of  the
Hyksos into Palestine occurred at the end of the Middle Bronze Age.
Middle Horizon: a division of time in Andean/Peruvian South America,
c. ad 600–1000, used to refer to the ﬁrst imperialistic domination of
the  area  under  the  unifying  forces  of  the  Tiahuanaco  and  Huari
(Wari) cultures. It was the time of the ﬁrst large-scale imperial expan-
sions. During the ﬁrst half of the Middle Horizon, in central Peru, the
Huari came to control the highlands and possibly the coast. The remains
of  large  groups  of  food-storage  buildings  in  the  Huari  strongholds 
suggest military activity like that of the late Inca. The Huari culture
is closely linked in its art style to the monuments of the great site of
Tiahuanaco, located on Lake Titicaca, Bolivia. Tiahuanaco expanded
over the altiplano and adjacent regions of Bolivia, southern Peru, and

198

MIDDLE  HORIZON

northern  Chile.  The  principal  buildings  of  Tiahuanaco  include:  the
Akapana  Pyramid,  a  huge  platform  mound  or  stepped  pyramid  of 
earth  faced  with  cut  andesite;  a  rectangular  enclosure  known  as 
the  Kalasasaya,  constructed  of  alternating  tall  stone  columns  and 
smaller  rectangular  blocks;  and  another  enclosure  known  as  the
Palacio.  They  practiced  the  raised-ﬁeld  system  of  agriculture.  Some
Tiahuanaco  efﬁgy  vessels  have  been  discovered  at  Huari,  but  other-
wise they seem to have been independent entities. In the second half
of the Middle Horizon, the political and economic systems slowly col-
lapsed.  The  decline  of  these  two  states  was  followed  by  a  period  of
more  localized  political  power.  The  Late  Intermediate  Period  began
about ad 1000.

Middle Kingdom: a period in Egyptian history including the 11th to 13th
dynasties, c. 2008–1630 bc. This phase began with the reuniﬁcation
of Upper and Lower Egypt by the 11th dynasty king Mentuhotep II
(Nebhapetre), ushering in years of stability and prosperity. It is usu-
ally divided into two phases, the early Middle Kingdom (late 11th and
early 12th dynasties) and the late Middle Kingdom (from the reign of
Senusret III to the end of the 13th dynasty).

Middle Paleolithic: the intermediate part of the Paleolithic period, from
about 100,000 years ago to about 35,000 years ago. It was charac-
terized  by  the  development  of  a  variety  of  stone  tools  and  the  ﬁrst
symbolic use of artifacts and sites. It ended with the extinction of the
Neanderthals. The Middle Paleolithic is equivalent to the Middle Stone
Age  in  sub-Saharan  Africa.  The  Middle  Paleolithic  comprises  the
Mousterian,  a  portion  of  the  Levalloisian,  and  the  Tayacian,  all  of
which are complexes based on the production of ﬂakes, although the
hand-ax  tradition  survived  in  many  instances.  Middle  Paleolithic
assemblages ﬁrst appear in deposits of the third interglacial and per-
sisted during the ﬁrst major oscillation of the fourth glacial (Würm)
stage. Associated with the Tayacian, in which the artifacts consist of
very crude ﬂakes, remains of modern man (Homo sapiens) have been
found. Mousterian man, on the other hand, is of the Neanderthal race.
It is in the Mousterian levels of the caves and rock shelters of central
and southern France that the earliest evidence of the use of ﬁre and
the ﬁrst deﬁnite burials have been discovered in western Europe. The
artifacts consist of: (1) the prepared striking platform, “tortoise” core
(Levalloisian)  tradition;  (2)  the  plain  striking  platform,  discoidal 
core  technique  of  the  Clactonian  tradition;  and  (3)  a  persistence  of
the bifacial core tool, or Acheulean tradition.

Middle Stone Age: the second part of the Stone Age in sub-Saharan Africa,
dating from c. 150,000 to 30,000 years ago and roughly equivalent
to  the  Middle  Paleolithic  elsewhere  in  the  Old  World.  Assemblages

MILESTONE

199

are  characterized  by  ﬂakes  made  by  preparing  the  core;  there  were
many shapes and sizes of these artifacts. The characteristic tools are
made  from  ﬂakes  produced  by  a  developed  Levalloisian  technique,
including slender unifacial and bifacial lances or spear points for stab-
bing or throwing. In the ﬁnal stages of the Middle Stone Age, known
as the South African Magosian, microlithic elements appear. Middle
Stone  Age  assemblages  are  associated  with  anatomically  modern
Homo  sapiens in  southern  Africa.  People  continued  to  live  in  open
camps, while rock overhangs also were used for shelter. Middle Stone
Age  bands  hunted  medium-size  and  large  prey.  Sometimes  they  col-
lected tortoises and ostrich eggs in large quantities, as well as seabirds
and marine mammals that could be found along the shore. The rich
archaeological deposits of Klasies River Mouth Cave preserve the earl-
iest evidence in the world for the use of shellﬁsh as a food source.

Middle Woodland period: a term sometimes used to describe the time
period during which the Hopewell culture ﬂourished throughout the
American Midwest, from roughly 50 bc to ad 400.

Midland: Paleoindian complex of the North American Plains similar to
the Folsom but the point is different. The type site is the Scharbauer
site near Midland, Texas, though the culture is best represented at Hell
Gap.  A  skeleton  (Midland  Man)  of  a  young  woman  dating  to
10,000 bp from Scharbauer was one of the earliest acceptable human
remains in North America. The Midland point is an unﬂuted Folsom
point. [Midland point]

midline: in lithics, an imaginary line extending along the center of a pro-

jectile from the distal tip to the midpoint of the basal edge.

midpoint: in lithics, an imaginary point at the intersection of the mid-

line and the transverse line.

midrib:  the  raised  midline  or  thickening  of  the  center  line  of  a  bronze

weapon, such as a dagger, to add strength and reinforce the blade.

Migration period: the period of large-scale movement of peoples in west-
ern Europe during the 4th, 5th, and 6th centuries ad – including the
Anglo-Saxon settlement of England. These movements are associated
with the collapse of the Roman Empire. Barbarians from beyond the
Roman  frontiers  settled  within  many  of  the  former  provinces.  The
Migration  period  is  often  extended  to  cover  the  period  from  the 
3rd century ad to the accession of Charlemagne in ad 800.

Mildenhall ware: a type of Middle Neolithic pottery of central-eastern
England and East Anglia c. 4th millennium bc. It consists mainly of
round-bottomed bowls with elaborate decoration and deep S-proﬁled
forms with rolled or thickened rims.

milestone: roman road markers – cylindrical blocks of stone usually about
1.8 m (6 feet) high – recording the distance from a central point within

the province or a local center. These were placed along all principal
roads, and instances are found from about 250 bc onwards. The stone
was  typically  inscribed  to  give  the  distance  in  (Roman)  miles  to  the
nearest major town, and commonly a date of installation, expressed
in terms of republican magistracies, or the years of an emperor’s reign.
They often bore the title of the emperor or consults under whose direc-
tion the road was laid out or repaired.

milleﬁore: a type of multicolored glass and the technique which creates
it  –  literally  meaning  “a  thousand  ﬂowers.”  One  milleﬁore  method 
is  to  take  a  cane  of  glass,  encase  it  with  several  layers  of  glass  of 
different colors, and then heat the whole and roll it on a corrugated
surface, thus compressing the colors at certain points and producing
a  rod  with  a  ﬂowerlike  section.  Small  slices  can  be  cut  off  this  rod
and inlaid into the object to be decorated. Another method is to lay
thin glass rods of different colors into a pattern, fuse them together,
draw them out, and cut in slices in the same way. The effect is that
of mosaic. The technique was developed by Anglo-Saxon glass- and
metalworkers. Some of the ﬁnest examples of the milleﬁore technique
can be seen adorning the Sutton Hoo discoveries – the brilliant reds
and blues on the purse lid and shoulder clasps. [milleﬁori]

milling stone: any stone slab or basin that is used to process seeds, nuts,
and other such foods by rubbing, grinding, or pounding them against
this object with another stone. [grinding stone, metate]

millstone:  one  of  a  pair  of  cylindrical  stones  used  in  a  mill  for  grind-
ing grain in a mill. One face of each stone is roughened by means of 
a  pattern  of  lines  cut  into  the  surface  while  the  other  face  may  be 
slightly domed. Millstones were used in pairs (an upper and lower stone),
a central hole in each taking the spindle that keeps them concentric
and in the case of the upper stone attaches to the power source that
turns it.

Mimbres  culture: pueblo-based  farming  communities  living  along  the
Mimbres  River  in  southwest  New  Mexico,  US  c.  ad 1000–1130.
Mimbres is probably best known for its very ﬁne ceramics, which include
magniﬁcent  ceremonial  bowls  adorned  with  painted  geometric  and 
pictorial designs. Examples are often found inverted over the head of
the deceased in burial deposits, ritually broken by making a small hole
in the center of the base.

Mimi  style:  a  style  of  art  associated  with  the  Pirri  culture  of  Arnhem
Land  in  which  plain  red  stylized  human  ﬁgures  showing  vigorous 
movement are depicted. The thin, stick-like human ﬁgures are a fea-
ture of the Arnhem Land rock art of northern Australia. The paint-
ing  are  thought  to  be  about  3000  years  old,  earlier  than  X-ray  art.

MINYAN  WARE

201

Mina: a pottery style found in coastal shell mounds in Brazil near the
mouth of the Amazon, with a radiocarbon date around 3880 bc. It
is among the oldest pottery in the New World.

Mindel  glaciation:  the  second  major  Pleistocene  glaciation  of  Alpine 
Europe which ended with the onset of the Holsteinian interglacial. It
was  the  second  major  ice  age  in  the  Pleistocene  period,  shown  in
Quaternary deposits in the Alps and the valleys of south German rivers.
The Mindel consists of moraine and related river terraces of pro-glacial
deposits.  The  Mindel  glacial  stage  is  part  of  the  early  geological
scheme (developed c. 1900) that ﬁrst recognized the importance of mul-
tiple  episodes  of  Pleistocene  glaciation.  The  stage,  a  period  of  rela-
tively  severe  climatic  conditions  and  glacial  advance,  preceded  the
Mindel-Riss  interglacial  and  followed  the  Günz-Mindel  interglacial,
both  periods  of  relatively  moderate  climatic  conditions.  The  Mindel
glacial stage lasted from about 750,000 to 675,000 years ago. At least
two periods of glacial advance, separated by a moderate period, are
recognized in the Mindel.

Mindel-Riss: the interglacial stage that followed the Mindel glacial stage,
a separation between the Mindel and Riss glacials in Alpine Europe.
mineral:  a  solid  homogeneous  crystalline  chemical  element  or  com-
pound that results from the inorganic processes of nature. The term
includes  any  of  various  ground  substances  such  as  stone,  coal,  salt,
sulfur, sand, petroleum, water, or natural gas. Each of these naturally
occurring  substances  has  a  characteristic  chemical  composition
expressed by a chemical formula.

mingqi:  a  Chinese  term  used  to  describe  small  objects,  sometimes 
imitating objects of daily life or buildings. They were placed in tombs
as offerings and were of fairly early origin, some from the Shang period.
miniature cup: any of a number of small ceramic vessels accompanying
Bronze Age cremation burials in the British Isles during the 2nd mil-

Minyan ware: a distinctive Middle Helladic pottery – a gray or yellow
wheelmade ware of high quality ﬁrst appearing at Troy VI and in Greece
c. 19th century bc. It was the ﬁrst wheelmade pottery to be produced
in Middle Bronze Age Greece. It was ancestral to Mycenaean pottery,
and may represent a movement of new peoples into the Aegean area,
the ﬁrst Greek speakers. Traditionally it has been associated with an
apparently violent end to the Early Helladic culture, c. 2000–1900 bc,

and  the  arrival  of  Greek-speaking  peoples  in  the  Aegean.  The  term
was  coined  by  Heinrich  Schliemann.  The  ware  had  a  soap-like  feel-
ing and its forms were modeled after metal objects.

Miocene:  a  geological  epoch  of  the  Tertiary  period  in  the  Earth’s  his-
tory, in which many of the great mountain chains were formed and
mammals  came  to  dominate  animal  life.  During  this  epoch,  many 
mammals of modern form, such as dogs, horses, and human-like apes,
evolved.  The  Miocene  occurred  after  the  Oligocene  and  before  the
Pliocene and is dated between 25 and 5 (23.7–5.3) million years ago
(mya). It is often divided into the Early Miocene epoch (23.7–16.6 mya),
the  Middle  Miocene  epoch  (16.6–11.2  mya),  and  the  Late  Miocene
epoch (11.2–5.3 mya). The Miocene may also be divided into six ages
and their corresponding rock stages; from oldest to youngest these ages
or  stages  are  the  Aquitanian,  Burdigalian,  Langhian,  Serravallian,
Tortonian, and Messinian.

mirror:  a  polished  metal  artifact  with  functional  and  symbolic  uses.  It
was made in the Iron Age and the backs were decorated in beautiful
La  Tène  designs.  It  was  also  made  in  Egypt  from  at  least  the  Old
Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 bc). In China, mirrors were thought to have
magical powers to inﬂuence the spirits, and were therefore frequently
buried in tombs from the late Zhou/Chou dynasty (1072–221 bc) until
the  T’ang  dynasty  (ad 618–906]).  Made  of  bronze,  they  were  cast 
with elaborate decoration on the reverse of a highly polished convex
surface.  In  Japan,  many  round  imported  mirrors  and  their  domestic
copies are found from Yayoi and Kofun graves. In the Greek and Roman
world, mirrors were made of polished tin and bronze, decorated, and
had handles of bone or ivory. Celtic Britain had ﬁne bronze mirrors
c. 100 bc to ad 100.

misericorde:  a  narrow-bladed  dagger  of  the  14th  century,  which  was
pushed through the eye slits or between the armor plates of a knight
immobilized on the ground by the weight of their armor, and so giv-
ing the coupe de grâce.

Mississippian:  a  group  of  cultures  which  arose  in  southeastern  North
America – especially the central and lower Mississippi Valley – after
ad 700  and  into  the  historic  period.  It  spread  over  a  great  area  of 
the  southeast  and  mid-continent,  in  the  river  valleys  of  what  are 
now the states of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, Missouri,
Kentucky,  Illinois,  Indiana,  and  Ohio,  with  scattered  extensions
northward into Wisconsin and Minnesota and westward into the Great
Plains.  It  stands  in  contrast  to  the  Woodland  tradition  having  three
new traits – the building of rectangular, ﬂat-topped mounds as bases
for  temples;  burial  mounds  becoming  less  prominent;  and  radical 
pottery changes (pulverized shell rather than grit used for temper). New

MOBILIARY  ART

pottery shapes and forms, such as olla, and new types of decoration
(burnishing, painting) appeared. Maize became the predominant crop,
accompanied  by  beans  and  squash,  which  supplemented  hunting 
and  gathering.  The  largest  of  the  earthworks  is  Monks  Mound,  in 
the  Cahokia  Mounds  near  Collinsville,  Illinois.  The  Mississippian  is
divided into the periods Temple Mound I (c. ad 700–1200) and Temple
Mound  II  (ad 1200–1700).  It  was  the  last  major  cultural  tradition 
in prehistoric North America. By the late 17th century, all the major
centers had been abandoned.

Mladec point: a point made from bone, antler, or ivory with an elong-
ated oval shape. It has been found at Aurignacian sites in central Europe.

MNI: the minimum number of individuals represented in a given faunal
or human bone collection; determined from the number in the largest
category of skeletal elements recovered. It is a method of assessing species
abundance in faunal assemblages based on a calculation of the smallest
number of animals necessary to account for all the identiﬁed bones. It
is usually calculated from the most abundant bone or tooth from either
the left or right side of the animal. [minimum number of individuals]
moai: 1. Colossal stone ﬁgures found on Easter Island carved between
approximately ad 600 and 1500. There are 800–1000 known to have
been  quarried  from  the  volcanic  tuff  at  Rano  Raraku.  They  can  be
up to 10 m (33 feet) tall and up to 28 tons in weight. Many were put
in ahu on the coast, on top and facing inland. The moai were prob-
ably  ancestor  ﬁgures.  Most  of  the  moai  were  knocked  over  during 
internal  strife  on  the  island.  2.  A  small  wooden  statue  of  uncertain
religious signiﬁcance, also carved on Easter Island. The ﬁgures are of
two types, moai kavakava (male) and moai paepae (female). They were
sometimes  used  for  fertility  rites  but  were  more  often  used  for  har-
vest celebrations. During the time between these public festivals, the
statues were wrapped in bark cloth and kept in private homes.

mobiliary  art:  a  general  term  used  to  describe  the  small  and  portable
objects produced by artists during the Upper Paleolithic period. These
included carved or engraved stone, bone, ivory, or antler, and small
crudely  ﬁred  clay  models.  Artifacts  include  ﬁgurines,  artists’  trial
pieces,  decorated  weapons,  tools,  and  ornaments.  The  distribution
extends from Siberia to Spain. Cave art covers the paintings, engrav-
ings,  and  reliefs  found  on  the  walls  of  caves  and  rock  shelters  of 
the same period. Unlike wall art, which is difﬁcult to date, mobiliary
art  is  usually  found  in  archaeological  layers  and  can  therefore  be 
dated.  The  earliest  pieces  probably  date  to  about  35,000  years  ago
and they continued being made throughout the Upper Paleolithic to
c. 10,000 bc. [chattel art, French art, mobilier home art]

MOCCASIN

moccasin: a soft leather slipper or shoe, having the sole turned up and
sewn  to  the  upper  in  a  gathered  seam,  originally  worn  by  North
American Indians.

mocha ware: a pottery ware of the late 18th through the early 20th cen-
turies,  ornamented  with  colored  glaze  worked  into  branch-like  pat-
terns by drops of a diffusing agent applied while the glaze is still wet.
Moche  culture: Early  Intermediate  Period  state-based  society  centered
on  the  northern  coast  of  Peru  in  South  America  during  the  period
ad 200–700. The site of Moche in the Moche Valley was the capital
of  the  Mochica  state  and  comprised  two  huge  adobe  platforms,  an
immense plaza, and an extensive residential area. Moche pottery includes
stirrup-spouted funerary vessels on which there are painted depictions
of gods, ceremonies, and scenes from everyday life. [Mochica culture]
mocronate  tip:  a  type  of  distal  end  or  tip  treatment  in  which  a  small

sharp nipple has been left on the very tip of the blade.

mode: the most speciﬁc category of classiﬁcation for artifacts, representing
items  within  the  same  type  and  variety  that  share  further  common
attributes. Modes are single or multiple attributes whose frequencies
change  through  time  and  space.  They  are  useful  in  constructing 
culture history.

modeling: a ceramic vessel construction technique where a mass of clay
is handworked into a rough approximation of the vessel through punch-
ing, pinching, and/or drawing.

Moershoofd  interstadial:  an  interstadial  of  the  Weichselian  cold  stage.

It is dated to c. 50,000–43,000 bp.

Mogollon  tradition:

later  prehistoric  farming  communities  living  in
Arizona and New Mexico, US, in the period c. ad 250–1450. Charac-
terized by distinctive red-on-brown and polished red ceramics, early
Mogollon settlements were small villages with few houses and large
associated ceremonial complexes.

Mohs  scale:  a  scale  from  1  to  10  used  to  determine  the  hardness  of 
minerals, talc being 1 and diamond being 10. It is a rough measure
of  the  resistance  of  a  smooth  surface  to  scratching  or  abrasion  by 
a  substance  of  known  or  deﬁned  hardness,  expressed  in  terms  of  a
scale  devised  in  1812  by  the  German  mineralogist  Friedrich  Mohs.

mokkan: in Japan, wooden tablets from the Han dynasty Chinese sites.
There were used for keeping track of taxes, work, etc. and thousands
have been found in the Heijo Palace and other administrative ofﬁces.
The United Silla of Korea and the Ritsuryo state in Japan, c. 8th cen-
tury ad, adopted their use.

mold: a hollow container used to give shape to molten or hot liquid mater-

ial (such as wax or metal) when it cools and hardens.

mold  construction:  preparing  paste  into  a  prepared  form  or  mold,

which then imparts its shape to the paste.

molding: 1. A ceramic vessel construction technique where a ﬂat, circular
mass of clay is pressed into a concave mold, or placed over the top
of a convex mold. 2. Any prepared receptacle used to impart speciﬁc
shapes to materials such as clay, glass, or metal.

monitoring:  making  periodic  checks  on  the  condition  of  collections,
recharging exhausted silica gel, and taking action on deteriorated objects
where necessary.

monstrance: an ornamental vessel of gold, silver, silver-gilt, or gilded or
silvered  copper,  in  which  the  Eucharistic  Host  is  carried  in  proces-
sions and ceremonies. The decoration often represents a sun with rays,
in  the  center  of  which  is  a  lunule  or  glass  box  in  which  the  con-
secrated wafer is carried and exposed on the altars of churches. The
earliest monstrances do not date before the 12th century. First used
in  France  and  Germany  in  the  14th  century,  monstrances  were 
modeled after pyxes or reliquaries, sacred vessels for keeping the Host
in. [expositorium, ostensorium]

montmorillonite: a common clay mineral of the smectite group, having

a small particle size and an expanding lattice.

mood: a blank for a knife that has not been hammered out.
morphological  type:  a  descriptive  and  abstract  grouping  of  individual
artifacts whose focus is on overall similarity rather than speciﬁc form
or function. The shape, size, and superﬁcial characteristics of artifacts,
features,  structure,  sites,  etc.  provided  by  measurements  (including
weight)  permit  the  comparative  statistical  analysis  of  attributes  and
frequencies. [morphological typology]

Morrow  Mountain  point:  Middle  Archaic  bifacially  worked  chipped 
stone projectile points of eastern North America dating to the period
c.  6000–4000 bc.  The  points  are  triangular  in  outline  with  slightly
ﬂared sides towards the base and a small rounded tang on the base.
mortar: 1. Part of an ancient device for processing plant foods, usually
used with a pestle. It was a stone or wooden receptacle with a cup-
shaped depression. Mortars were frequently made of special rocks, which
might  be  traded  over  considerable  distances.  The  mortars  of  the
medieval  period  in  Europe  have  been  studied  at  length;  the  ﬁrst 
stone mortars occur in 8th century Dore-Stad and have origins in the
Moselle Valley, while the French Carolingians at this time were using
pottery mortars. 2. A mixture of lime with cement, sand, and water,
used in building to bond bricks or stones.

mortarium: a Roman grinding bowl, or mortar; a culinary pottery form.
Examples  are  often  stamped  with  the  maker’s  name,  and  some

MORTLAKE  WARE

Mortlake ware: a family of elaborately decorated Neolithic ceramics found
in southern and eastern parts of the British Isles. Dating to the period
3000–2000 bc,  Isobel  Smith  divided  Peterborough  wares  into  three
successive styles – Ebbsﬂeet, Mortlake, and Fengate – on the basis of
their  occurrence  in  the  ditch  ﬁlls  at  Windmill  Hill.  It  is  now  recog-
nized  that  these  three  groups  overlap  rather  more  than  originally
thought,  and  that  they  are  best  seen  as  part  of  the  broad  group  of
impressed wares found over much of northern Europe in the 3rd mil-
lennium bc.  The  decoration  on  Peterborough  ware  consists  of  pits,
“maggot impressions” made by impressing tightly rolled cord, and the
impressions made by pressing the ends of bird bones into the soft clay
before  ﬁring.  Some  of  the  later  vessels  are  the  ﬁrst  in  Britain  to  be
made with ﬂat bases. [Peterborough ware]

mosaic: a technique of decoration used mainly on ﬂoors or walls involv-
ing the setting of small colored fragments of stone, tile, mineral, shell,
or glass, each called a tessera (plural tesserae), in a cement or adhe-
sive matrix. Mosaic also refers to a tesselated area, often of complex
designs and, possibly, inscriptions. Mosaic ﬂoors were made from small
squares, triangles, or other regular shapes up to 2 cm (1 inch) in size.
They were laid in cement to form designs, ﬁgures of animals, or clas-
sical ﬁgures representing the seasons, etc. Old limestone would be used
for white and various reds, browns, or grays from baked clays were
used.  Glass,  too,  was  sometimes  incorporated.  The  earliest  known
mosaics  date  from  the  8th  century  bc and  are  made  of  pebbles,  a 
technique  reﬁned  by  Greek  craftsmen  in  the  5th  century  bc.  Greek
mosaics were simple pebble ﬂoors and then became more complex and
sophisticated  under  Macedonian  kings.  Mosaics  are  known  from
Pompeii,  Rome,  Tivoli,  Aquileia,  and  Ostia  –  as  well  as  Africa,
Antioch,  Sicily,  and  Britain.  Under  the  Roman  Empire,  the  achieve-
ments of the 5th to 6th-century Byzantine artists at Ravenna are impres-
sive. An excellent collection of mosaics from Pompeii may be seen in
the Mueo Nazionale at Naples, and a good selection of Imperial Roman
provincial work may be seen at the Museum of Le Bardo, outside mod-
ern Tunis, Tunisia. Pre-Columbian American Indians favored mosaics
of  semiprecious  stones  such  as  garnet  and  turquoise  and  mother-of-
pearl. These were normally used to encrust small objects such as shields,
masks, and cult statues. Mosaic as an art form has most in common
with  painting.  It  represents  a  design  or  image  in  two  dimensions.  It
is  also,  like  painting,  a  technique  appropriate  to  large-scale  surface
decoration. [mosaic work]

motif:  a  single  repeated  design  (or  color);  an  element  in  a  (usually) 

complex design. It may be nonrepresentational or pictorial.

mottled: having spots of different colors or shades.

motto beaker: a beaker decorated with white-painted scrolls and words

forming phrases or maxims, made in Gaul or the Rhineland.

Mousterian: a Middle Paleolithic culture that is deﬁned by the develop-
ment of a wide variety of specialized tools made with prepared-core
knapping  techniques,  such  as  spear  points.  It  is  named  for  the  ﬁrst
such artifacts recovered from the lower rock shelter at Le Moustier,
Dordogne, France. Stone tools, scrapers, and points found in the cave
came to be recognized as the ﬂint industry present throughout Europe
during  ﬁrst  half  of  the  last  glaciation  (Würm)  and  associated  with
Neanderthal man. The earliest Mousterian goes back to the Riss glacia-
tion,  but  most  of  it  comes  from  the  late/middle  Würm  glaciation, 
giving a total lifespan from 180,000 bc until c. 30,000 bce. Flintwork
of  Mousterian  type  (with  racloirs,  triangular  points  made  on  ﬂakes,
and – in some variants – well-made hand axes) has been found over
most of the unglaciated parts of Eurasia, as well as in the Near East
and  North  Africa  (in  the  latter  two  areas,  it  constitutes  the  Middle
Paleolithic).  Three  major  regional  variants  have  been  identiﬁed  –
West,  East,  and  Levalloiso-Mousterian,  each  with  subgroups.  In 
certain industries, called Levalloiso-Mousterian, the tools were made
on  ﬂakes  produced  by  the  Levallois  technique.  It  was  a  progressive
stage  in  the  manufacture  of  stone  tools.  Mousterian  peoples  mainly
lived in cave mouths and rock shelters. [Mousterian industry]

mouth: the oriﬁce or opening of a hollow ware vessel.
mud  brick:  a  brick  dried  in  the  sun  rather  than  baked,  used  for  con-
struction in dry climates, such as the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and
Mesoamerica. In a dry climate, where fuel for baking brick is scarce,
bricks were and are commonly sun-dried only. A building constructed
of these can expect only a limited life, perhaps 30 years. When it col-
lapses, new brick would be brought in for any new building, which
would be superimposed on the leveled ruins of the old, with the ﬂoor
at a correspondingly higher level. It is this process which largely explains
the great height and bulk of Near Eastern tells. The two principal build-
ing materials used in ancient Egypt were unbaked mud brick and stone.
Mud brick was even used for royal palaces, fortresses, and the great
walls of temple precincts and towns, and for subsidiary buildings in
temple complexes. The ﬁrst ﬁred bricks appeared about 3000 bc (in
Mesopotamia). [adobe, mud-brick, pisé]

Mudejar:  a  unique  style  of  art  and  architecture,  part  Gothic,  part
Islamic, which developed in the Iberian peninsula during the Moorish
occupation  of  the  12th  to  15th  centuries.  The  style,  marked  by  the
frequent use of the horseshoe arch and vault, distinguishes the church
and  palace  architecture  of  Toledo,  Córdoba,  Seville,  and  Valencia. 
Many of the greatest Mudejar buildings were constructed by Moorish

Alcazar in Seville.

muff glass: a ﬂat piece of window glass made by blowing a bubble of
glass and swinging it from the pipe to create a long cylindrical bub-
ble. The ends were cut off and then it was split along the middle and
allowed to uncurl on a ﬂat surface inside an oven to make a sheet of
glass. [cylinder glass]

mug: a large cup, typically cylindrical and with a handle.
muller: a small grinding stone, often for use with pigments but also for
grains, ores, and drugs. In painting, it is an instrument used in con-
junction  with  a  slab  to  grind  artists’  colors  by  hand.  From  ancient
Egyptian  times  until  the  18th  century,  porphyry  (a  rock  of  feldspar
crystals) was used.

multidirectional core: a core that has had ﬂakes removed from two or

more directions.

multifaceted platform: a platform with more than one plane of detach-
ment, such as on the margins of some bifaces or multidirectional cores.
multiple ﬂuting: a technique of ﬂuting that involved the removal of two

short lateral ﬂutes in preparation for the removal of a longer ﬂute.

multivocality:  concept  that  an  artifact  can  have  different  meanings

depending on its context.

mummiﬁcation: technique of preserving a body whereby the viscera and
brain are extracted from the dried body prior to embalming it in sodium
carbonate and ﬁnally wrapping it in bandages and a canvas shroud.
This treatment of a cadaver, the mummy, had the aim of preserving
a  life-like  appearance  and  was  used  by  the  Egyptians  from  the  time
of the Old Kingdom. The preservation of the body was an essential
part  of  ancient  Egyptian  funerary  practice,  since  it  was  to  the  body
that the ka would return in order to ﬁnd sustenance. If the body had
decayed or was unrecognizable the ka would go hungry, and the after-
life  would  be  jeopardized.  Mummiﬁcation  was  therefore  dedicated 
to the prevention of decay. In the New Kingdom, new techniques of
removal of internal organs (though in the Late Period they were replaced
after treatment), use of effective desiccating agents, and subcutaneous
padding  made  mummiﬁcation  possible  on  a  large  scale.  Sacred  ani-
mals  and  birds  were  also  mummiﬁed.  Mummiﬁcation  was  accom-
panied  by  elaborate  rituals.  Among  the  many  other  peoples  who 
practiced  mummiﬁcation  were  people  living  along  the  Torres  Strait,
between  Papua  New  Guinea  and  Australia,  and  the  Incas  of  South
America. The term is also applied to bodies accidentally preserved in
this way in other parts of the world, as in desert regions of Peru and
Andean caves.

209

mummy:  dead  body  of  a  person  or  animal  preserved  according  to 
the  rites  practiced  in  ancient  Egypt.  After  removal  of  the  organs  to
separate canopic jars, the body was treated with resin (natron) to dry
it out thoroughly. It was then wrapped tightly in linen bandages, accom-
panied by jewelry, religious texts, and unguents of various kinds. Human
mummies were then generally enclosed in cartonnage, wooden, stone,
or  gold  cases  of  human  form,  before  being  placed  in  the  tomb.  All
stages  of  the  procedure  were  accompanied  by  elaborate  rituals, 
culminating  in  the  ceremony  of  the  “opening  of  the  mouth,”  which
symbolically  restored  to  the  completed  mummy  the  faculties  of  life.
The  practice  arose  from  the  accidental  preservation  of  bodies  by 
desiccation in the desert sand, giving rise to the idea that such preser-
vation was necessary to the survival of the dead man’s soul. It con-
tinued  until  the  end  of  pharaonic  times.  The  name  derives  from
“moumiya,” or bitumen, with which the Persians mistakenly thought
the bodies were coated.

mummy label: a type of identiﬁcation tag used during the Greco-Roman
period, when corpses were regularly being transported from the home
to the cemetery or back to their village. The tags were made of wood
and,  occasionally,  stone.  Mummy  labels  were  inscribed  with  short 
ink texts in Greek or demotic, giving the name, age, home town, and
destination of the deceased. [tabla (Greek)]

mumun: a Korean term meaning “no decoration” for the plain pottery
of the peninsula which succeeded Chulmun pottery from c. 1500 bc
to ad 300.  It  was  the  dominant  pottery  type  from  the  Bronze  Age
through the Proto-Three Kingdoms period.

Munsell  color  chart:  a  color  identiﬁcation  system  for  sediment,  soil, 
chert, pottery, and rock; an aid used in the physical examination and
recording of objects where color is felt to be an essential or at least
a signiﬁcant aspect of the analysis. Devised by Albert H. Munsell, the
three factors of hue, value, and chroma are taken into consideration,
all  rated  on  a  scale  of  0–10,  and  expressed  quantitatively.  Hue
describes  the  colors  of  the  spectrum  present,  value  their  concentra-
tion, and chroma their purity. The color of soil or, for example, pot-
tery, can be matched in the chart and given a value, so that anyone
with  a  similar  set  of  charts  can  understand  the  exact  color  of  the 
material.  The  method  allows  direct  comparison  of  colors  without 
physically moving the material, and is clearly preferable to the use of
such subjective descriptions as reddish-brown or yellowish-gray. The
charts are contained in a loose-leaf notebook with pages of hundreds
of standardized color chips, each perforated with a hole, by which the
color of the soil or other material can be compared with the standard
sample. [Munsell]

Nderit ware: ﬁrst discovered at Stable’s Drift on the Nderit River, south
of Lake Nakuru in the central Rift Valley of Kenya, Nderit ware is a
widespread  variety  of  pottery  which  may  predate  the  ﬂorescence  of
the Pastoral Neolithic in the area. It is one of several distinct pottery
wares  associated  with  the  Pastoral  Neolithic  in  Kenya  and  north-
ern  Tanzania.  It  is  characterized  by  ﬁnely  executed,  wedge-shaped 
decoration,  apparently  made  by  means  of  repeated  impressions  of  a
pointed object such as obsidian; it is also often deeply scored on the
inside surface of the vessel. In northern Kenya, the pottery occurs at

negative painting: a technique of pottery decoration used in many parts
of  the  Americas  in  which  a  design  area  is  covered  with  a  paint-
resistant substance (wax, gum, clay) and then dipped in paint or dye,
dried, and ﬁred. The pot might be either smoked or dipped into a black
wash. The dark coating is unable to reach those areas of the surface
protected by the resistant substance, and when the resistant substance
is  removed,  the  pattern  stands  out  in  the  original  color  against  the
black background. [resist dyeing]

nemset  vessel:  a  type  of  spouted  vase  or  lustration  vessel  usually  used
in ritual contexts such as the Egyptian “opening of the mouth” cere-

or mummies.

Nene Valley ware: a type of Roman pottery made by an organized indus-
try on the banks of the River Nene, west of Peterborough, by the Roman
town of Water Newton (ancient Durobrivae), England, from the 2nd
to  4th  centuries  ad.  (It  was  formerly  known  as  Castor  ware.)  The 
commonest shapes are drinking vessels and tumblers, made of a light
clay  with  a  dark  slip,  sometimes  with  white  decoration.  Decoration
was by applied scales, rouletting, or barbotine. Barbotine ornamenta-
tion  is  applied  to  pottery  by  squeezing  a  bag  containing  thin  clay 
slip  in  the  same  way  as  a  cake  is  iced  today.  It  may  be  applied  by
brush or spatula as well. The best known are the Hunt Cups, show-
ing dogs pursuing deer or hares, but human scenes also occur. It is a
local ware, made in imitation of the dark, glossy Rhenish wares, and
was perhaps the ﬁrst ﬁneware to be produced locally in Roman Britain.

Neo-Assyrian: a political period of the Assyrian Empire in the Iron Age,
an  extension  of  the  Middle  Assyrian.  It  lasted  from  Assurnasirpal 
II  (883–859 bc)  until  Sargon,  Sennacherib,  Esarhaddon,  and  ﬁnally

NEOLITHIC

213

Assurbanipal (668–627 bc). The Assyrian Empire was destroyed by
the  Babylonians  and  Medes  in  612 bc.  The  Neo-Assyrian  period 
was  the  great  era  of  Assyrian  power,  and  writings  culminated  in 
the  extensive  records  from  the  library  of  Ashurbanipal  at  Nineveh 
(c. 650 bc). Neo-Assyrian is also the name of the cuneiform script of
the time.

Neo-Babylonian:  a  political  and  economic  period  of  weakness  during
the  early  1st  millennium  bc which  ended  with  the  absorption  of
Babylonia into the Neo-Assyrian Empire by 688 bc. A rebellion in the
620s evicted the Assyrians and in alliance with Medes, they destroyed
the Assyrian Empire in 612 bc. Persia’s Cyrus invaded and occupied
Babylon in 539 bc.

Neogene  period:  upper  division  of  the  Tertiary  system  including  the
Miocene  and  Pliocene  periods;  latest  of  the  two  divisions  of  the
Cenozoic  era  (66.4  million  years  ago  to  the  present).  The  Neogene,
which means “new born,” was designated as such to emphasize that
the marine and terrestrial fossils found in the strata of this time were
more closely related to each other than to those of the preceding period,
called  the  Paleogene.  The  term  Neogene  is  widely  used  in  Europe 
as  a  geological  division,  but  is  generally  not  employed  in  North
America, where the Cenozoic era is simply divided into the Tertiary
period (66,400,000–1,600,000 years ago) and the Quaternary period
(1,600,000 years ago to the present).

Neolithic:  the  period  of  prehistory  when  people  began  to  use  ground
stone tools, to cultivate plants, and to domesticate livestock, but before
the use of metal for tools. It is the technical name for the New Stone
Age  in  the  Old  World  following  the  Mesolithic.  In  the  Neolithic, 
villages were established, pottery and weaving appeared, and farming
began. The Neolithic began about 8000–7000 bc in the Middle East
and about 4000–3000 bc in Europe. It was followed by the Bronze
Age, which began about 3500–3000 bc in the Middle East and about
2000–1500 bc in  Europe.  The  criteria  for  “deﬁning”  the  Neolithic 
has  become  progressively  more  difﬁcult  to  apply  as  both  food  pro-
duction and metalworking took a long time to develop. In Britain, the
Neolithic has other more speciﬁc characteristics: the use of pottery and
of ground stone (beside the long-employed ﬂaked stone), and the appear-
ance of construction works like the long barrow, causewayed camp,
and  megalithic  tomb.  Elsewhere,  however,  some  Mesolithic  cultures
made  use  of  pottery,  in  Japan  for  example;  and  certain  so-called 
Pre-Pottery  Neolithic  groups  had  none,  as  at  Jericho.  If  the  term
Neolithic is to be retained at all, it must be based on the appearance
of  food  production  (especially  cereal  grains),  sometimes  called  the
Neolithic Revolution, commencing in southwest Asia 9000–6000 bc.

NEOLITHIC

This might be considered the most important single advance ever made
by man, since it allowed him to settle permanently in one spot. This
in turn encouraged the accumulation of material possessions, stimu-
lated  trade,  and  by  producing  a  storable  surplus  of  food  allowed  a
larger population and craft specialization. All these were prerequisite
to  further  human  progress.  The  Neolithic  was  followed  by  the
Mesolithic period, the Chalcolithic, or the Bronze Age, depending on
the terminology used in different areas and the nature of the archae-
ological sequence itself. The Neolithic followed the Paleolithic period.
Neopalatial: the period of the New or Second palaces of Minoan Crete.
It is also known as Minoan III–Late Minoan IIIA1, c. 1700–1375 bc,
in traditional chronology.

Neothermal: postglacial times; a period of time from about 11,000 years

ago to the present.

nephrite: the more common form of jade, an iron calcium magnesium
silicate of the amphibole mineral group. It is whitish to dark green in
color, though it can be blue and black, and is prized as an ornamen-
tal  stone  for  carving  and  jewelry.  Jadeite  is  tougher  and  more  com-
pact. Sources of the material are known in China, Siberia, Pakistan,
New Zealand, the Philippines, New Guinea and Australia, Poland, the
Swiss Alps, Italy and Sicily, and North and South America. [jade]
net ﬂoat: an object designed to ﬂoat in water and to support a net.
net sinker: a term applied loosely to any perforated stone or terra cotta
object  that  may  have  been  used  to  keep  a  ﬁshing  net  vertical  in  the
water. They are found all over the world. [net weight, sinker]

netting needle: a needle for making and mending nets, often forked at
both ends and with a hollow center in which the thread or twine can
be wound.

New Forest ware: one of the pottery wares of southern Roman Britain
in the late 3rd to 4th centuries ad, produced by craftsmen in the New
Forest  area.  Decoration  is  scarce,  consisting  of  white  slipped  scrolls
or rosette stamps or stamped-on designs. Vessel shapes included cups,
ﬂagons,  and  mortaria.  It  was  of  two  kinds  –  one  a  hard  gray  ware,
with a painted, white ornamentation and a dark purple glaze, and the
other  a  creamy  ware  with  a  red  slip.  It  had  limited  distribution,  no
farther than 80 km (50 miles) from the kilns.

New Kingdom: a period of Egyptian history comprising the 18th to 20th
dynasties, c. 1550–1070 bc. It was the period following the expulsion
of Asiatic Hyksos rulers and the subsequent reuniﬁcation by Thutmose
I–IV, Amenhotep, Akhenaten, Tutankhamen, and Ramses I–XI. The
Egyptian army pushed beyond the traditional frontiers of Egypt into
Syria-Palestine. The Theban conquerors established the 18th dynasty
(1550–1295 bc), creating a great empire under a succession of rulers

NODULE

215

bearing the names Thutmose and Amenhotep. The newly reuniﬁed land
had a stronger economy, supplemented by resources of the empire in
Nubia and western Asia. To this period belongs much of the monu-
mental architecture of Egypt. From the beginning of the New Kingdom,
temples  of  the  gods  became  the  principal  monuments;  royal  palaces
and private houses, which are very little known, were less important.
Temples and tombs were stone with relief decoration on their walls
and were ﬁlled with stone and wooden statuary, inscribed and decorated
stelae (freestanding small stone monuments), and, in their inner areas,
composite works of art in precious materials.

niello:  powdered  sulﬁdes  of  copper,  silver,  and  lead,  heated  and  used 
to  make  a  bluish-black  plastic  substance  applied  to  metalwork.  The
material  was  soft;  it  was  cast  into  the  cut-out  pattern  on  the  object
and  polished  ﬂat.  It  was  used  in  particular  to  decorate  the  inlaid 
daggers of shaft grave circles at Mycenae. The art of chasing out lines
or forms, and inlaying a black composition was probably well known
to  the  Greeks.  The  Byzantines  compounded  silver,  lead,  sulfur,  and
copper,  and  laid  it  on  the  silver  in  a  powder,  then  put  it  through  a
furnace, where it melted and was incorporated with the solid metal.
Germanic  and  Anglo-Saxon  metalworkers  also  used  the  technique.
Objects  decorated  with  niello,  called  nielli,  are  usually  small  in 
scale.  During  the  Renaissance,  at  the  height  of  its  popularity,  the 
technique was widely used for the embellishment of liturgical objects
and for the decoration of cups, boxes, knife handles, and belt buckles.
[nigellum, Tula work]

Ninevite 5: the period or horizon c. 2900–2500 bc in northern Meso-
potamia  characterized  by  distinctive  painted  and  incised  or  excised 
pottery. The name derives from the site of Nineveh where it was ﬁrst
excavated. The term also refers to the pottery itself.

Noailles burin: an Upper Paleolithic ﬂake tool retouched to give several
chisel-like edges; the Noailles burin also distinguishes a facies of the
Upper  Perigordian  or  Noaillian,  dating  to  c.  27,000 bp.  The  Grotte
de  Noailles,  close  to  Brive,  Corrèze,  southwest  France,  has  given  its
name to this small multiple burin. [Noailles graver]

nock: one of the notches cut in either of two tips of horn attached to the
ends of a bow for holding the bowstring or a groove into which the
bowstring is inserted on an arrow. The term is also used for the part
of an arrow having a notch for the bowstring and for the notch itself.
nodule: a hard mass of mineral, usually rounded, found in various forms
in soil and created by the deposition of minerals from solution. The
way nodules are formed can assist in paleoenvironmental reconstruc-
tion and the age of the conditions under which they formed. Nodules
are  often  elongate  with  a  knobby  irregular  surface;  they  usually  are

216

NODULE

oriented parallel to the bedding. Chert and ﬂint often occur as dense
and structureless nodules of nearly pure silica in limestone or chalk,
where they seem to be replacements of the carbonate rock by silica.
nomoli: ﬁgures carved in soapstone by the Mende in Sierra Leone, which
were set up in shelters to protect the crop. The ﬁgures are similar in
style  and  are  thought  to  be  similar  in  date  to  ivories  carved  in  the
16th century for Portuguese traders in the adjacent Sherbro area.

noncortical ﬂake: a ﬂake having no cortex. [interior ﬂake, tertiary ﬂake]
nonplastic: material in a clay, mineral or organic, which by virtue of a
generally large particle size lacks the property of plasticity and reduces
the stickiness of the clay.

Northampton  ware:  type  of  late  Saxon  pottery  of  the  midlands  of

England, c. ad 850–1150.

Northern Black Polished ware: a ﬁne gray metallic ware with a glossy
black  surface  characteristic  of  the  Iron  Age  civilization  of  northern
and central India, dating to c. 500–100 bc. It is a hard, wheelmade
ware,  mainly  consisting  of  bowls  and  dishes.  The  surface  is  made 
with  an  alkali  ﬂux  and  ﬁred  in  a  reducing  atmosphere.  It  succeeds
Painted  Grey  ware  in  the  Ganges  sequence  and  is  the  main  pottery
type  associated  with  the  Ganges  civilization.  It  characterizes  the
urban kingdoms of early historic India. [NBP, NBPW, northern black
polished ware]

nosed scraper: narrow blade tool with a convex working edge at one or

both ends. [end scraper]

notch:  a  ﬂaked  U-  or  V-shaped  indentation;  matching  indentations  in

the point base area or corners or sides. [notched (adj.)]

Side-notched

Bottom-notched Corner-notched

Corner- and

notch  width:  in  lithics,  the  measurement  of  the  space  between  the

notches across the narrowest part of the stem or base of the point.

notching: practice of chipping small, semicircular notches out of the base
or side of a projectile point in order to aid in hafting. [notched (adj.)]
notching ﬂake: a ﬂake produced when putting hafting notches on a stone

tool.

nucleus:  block  of  primary  material  from  which  ﬂakes  have  been
removed  by  percussion  for  use  in  tools.  The  nucleus  is  what  is  left
after the stone has been worked on and often bears characteristic signs
of the method used. [core]

O

oar: a pole with a ﬂat blade, used for rowing or steering a boat, which
differs  from  a  paddle  in  being  secured  to  the  side  of  the  boat  itself
and being used in pairs.

obelisk:  ancient  Egyptian  monolithic  monument,  consisting  of  a  stone
pillar with tapering square section and a pyramid top (called a pyra-
midion  or  benbenet  (Egyptian)).  They  were  erected  for  religious  or 
monumental  purposes  and  frequently  bear  carved  inscriptions  in
hieroglyphs.  Old  Kingdom  examples  were  squat  and  closely  related
to the pyramids, both being solar symbols. They were set up in pairs
outside  the  entrances  to  some  Old  Kingdom  tombs,  and  outside 
temples; a single obelisk in east Karnak was the object of a cult. Later
ones, such as Cleopatra’s Needle, one of a pair erected by Thothmes
III at Heliopolis, were much more slender. They were derived ultimately
from  the  ancient  benben  stone  in  the  temple  of  the  sun-god  at
Heliopolis.  This  stone  was  believed  to  be  that  on  which  the  rays  of
the  rising  sun  ﬁrst  fell,  sacred  at  least  by  the  1st  dynasty  (3100–
2890 bc). Obelisks were usually cut from hard stone, particularly red
granite from Aswan. The largest surviving examples (30 m (98 feet)
high,  450  tons)  were  products  of  the  New  Kingdom.  The  earliest 
surviving obelisk dates from the reign of Sesostris I (1918–1875 bc)
and stands at Heliopolis, where once stood a temple to Re. [needle,
tekhen (Egyptian)]

object clustering: an approach to typology based on clusters of human

artifacts that are seen as speciﬁc classiﬁcatory types.

objet d’art: an object of artistic value.
oblique: at an angle to both the vertical and horizontal.
oblique ﬂaking: a ﬂaking technique in which the ﬂake scars appear from

left to right diagonally across the face of an artifact.

218

OBLIQUE  STRIAE

oblique striae: slanting linear marks, ridges, or grooves, especially one

of a number of similar features.

obliquely  blunted  point:  an  early  Mesolithic  microlith  of  northern
Europe,  etc.,  that  has  a  narrow  ﬂint  blade  backed  or  blunted  along
one edge toward the tip.

oblique-transverse ﬂaking: a unique ﬂaking style in which the removal
of ﬂakes from a blade face results in long diagonal parallel ﬂake scars
that  extend  from  one  side  of  the  blade  across  the  blade  face  to  the
other side of the blade.

obol: Greek silver coin, six of which equaled a drachma.
obsidian: a jet-black to gray, naturally occurring volcanic glass, formed
by rapid cooling of viscous lava. It was often used as a raw material
for  the  manufacture  of  stone  tools  and  was  very  popular  as  a  sup-
erior  form  of  ﬂint  for  ﬂaking  or  as  it  is  easily  chipped  to  form
extremely sharp edges. Obsidian breaks with a conchoidal fracture and
is  easily  chipped  into  precise  and  delicate  forms.  It  was  very  widely
traded from the anciently exploited sources in Hungary, Sardinia, Lipari
of Sicily, Melos in the Aegean, central and eastern Anatolia, Mexico,
etc. Chemical analysis of their trace elements now allows most of the
sources  to  be  distinguished  (especially  by  neutron  activation  and  X-
ray ﬂuorescence spectrometry), so that the pattern of trade spreading
out from each can be traced. Two dating methods have been applied
to  obsidian:  obsidian  hydration  dating  and  ﬁssion  track  dating.  In
Europe, obsidian was exploited extensively from c. 6000–3000 bc; after
3000 bc it generally went out of favor for everyday purposes (perhaps
as  a  result  of  competition  from  metal  tools)  but  it  continued  to  be
used for prestige objects in some areas, especially by the Minoans and
Mycenaeans.  Obsidian  has  been  quarried  and  traded  by  western
Melanesians since at least 19,000 bp, with the earliest-used and most
important source being that at Talasea on New Britain. Obsidian was
also an important trade item in Mesoamerica.

obtuse: a term used to describe a rounded tip or blunt-tipped artifact.
obverse: side of a coin or medal bearing the head or principal design.
obverse face: on a ﬂuted projectile, it is the face from which the initial

or primary ﬂute was removed.

occupation span: time period during which a site is occupied by humans.
ocher:  soft  varieties  of  iron  oxide  (hematite,  limonite,  goethite)  which
were  ground  and  used  with  other  materials  in  prehistory  to  make 
pigment.  Ocher  occurs  naturally  and  was  much  used  for  coloring 
matter, as in cave art, pottery painting, and personal decoration. Red
ocher was certainly used ceremonially to give an impression of life to
the corpse during funerary rites. There are many records from the Upper

OGEE

219

Paleolithic onwards of ocher staining of skeletons. It was mixed with
earth,  clay,  blood,  or  grease  to  make  the  paint.  Ocher  was  used  as
crayons or powder in the Aurignacian period for paintings on walls
of caves or on bone or stone artifacts. It was mainly yellow, brown,
black, orange, or red (hematite). [ochre]

ocher-colored  pottery:  an  Indian  pottery  type  that  was  a  distinctive 
ceramic of the post-Harappan upper Ganges Valley. It is a thick and 
usually badly ﬁred and badly preserved red ware with an ocher wash,
and its importance lies in the fact that it serves to bridge the gap in
the later 2nd millennium between the Harappan material of the Indus
civilization  and  the  Black-and-Red  and  Painted  Gray  wares  of  the 
Iron  Age.  The  earliest  date  for  the  ware  comes  from  Jodhpura  in
Rajasthan c. early 3rd millennium bc, but in the upper Ganges Valley
it has early 2nd millennium bc dates. It has been found in association
with a harpoon of Gangetic-hoard type at Saipai and with Gangetic
hoards. [ochre-colored pottery, OCP]

oculists’ stamp: any small rectangular tablets of stone with inscriptions

cut in the sides for marking eye ointment prescription cakes.

oculus:  1.  A  decorative  motif  on  pottery  and  rock  art  consisting  of  a
pair of circles or spirals resembling a pair of eyes. This motif was found
in  western  Europe  c.  3rd  millennium  bc and  in  passage  grave  art. 
2. A round window or opening in the top of a dome.

Odderade interstadial: an interstadial of the Weichselian cold stage, dated
by radiocarbon to c. 58,000 bp, but it may be earlier. The beginning
of the Weichsel has been placed at about 70,000 years ago.

oenochoe: a wine jug from the Classical period of Greek pottery, a grace-
ful  vessel  with  a  delicately  curved  handle  and  trefoil-shaped  mouth.
It  was  used  to  take  the  wine  out  of  the  crater  and  distribute  it  into
cups  (especially  at  symposiums)  and  is  the  vase  carried  by  the  god-
desses and used for libations in conjunction with a phiale. It was made
from  precious  metal,  bronze,  or  clay.  The  oenochoe  was  revived 
during  the  Renaissance  and  again  during  the  Neoclassical  period  of
the 18th century. [oinochoe]

offering  table:  an  important  element  of  the  Egyptian  private  tomb
throughout the Pharaonic and Greco-Roman periods. It was usually
placed in an accessible location, such as the chapel, so that offerings
could be brought to it by the funerary priests or relatives of the deceased.
offertory: in Egyptian archaeology, an offering made to the gods. As an
artifact, it could take on various forms: outstretched hands support-
ing a cup, or spoons of ivory, wood, or bronze, the handle of which
is formed by a human ﬁgure.

ogee: a double curve, one concave and one convex.

220

OLD  BABYLONIAN  PERIOD

Old Babylonian period: chronological period of c. 2000–1600 bc when
there  were  competing  kingdoms  in  southern  Mesopotamia  which
were eventually conquered by Hammurabi of Babylon. The kingdoms
included Isin and Larsa, important during the ﬁrst half of the period,
and the large kingdom created by Hammurabi, which ﬂourished in the
second half. The period was a time of increasing intellectual endeavors
in literature, astronomy, mathematics, law, etc.

Old  Kingdom:  a  period  in  Egyptian  history  including  the  3rd  through
8th dynasties, c. 2575–2130 bc. It preceded the Middle Kingdom and
is marked by the building of colossal stone pyramids. Most of the royal
pyramid  complexes  and  private  mastaba  tombs  of  the  Memphite
necropolis were built during this time. The ﬁrst signiﬁcant ruler of the
3rd  dynasty  was  Djoser  Netjerikhet  (2667–2648 bc),  whose  step
pyramid still dominates the skyline of northern Saqqara. Also, the term
refers  to  one  of  the  two  main  periods  of  Hittite  history,  covering 
c. 1700–1500 bc (the New Kingdom, or Empire, was c. 1400–1180 bc).
With the end of the 8th dynasty, the Old Kingdom state collapsed.

Oldbury-type  bead:  type  of  Late  Iron  Age  bead  found  in  southeastern
England, hexagonal in outline with white spirals in a blue ground mass.
Older Dryas: a stadial of the Weichselian cold stage, dating to between

c. 12,000 and 11,800 bp.

Oldishi: Kenyan Pastoral Neolithic pottery tradition. There are southern,
eastern, and northern facies; Narosura ware belongs to the southern
facies.

Oldowan: an Earlier Stone Age industry and complex seen at Olduvai
Gorge in Tanzania and other African sites, dating from c. 2.5 million
to  about  1.6  million  years  ago  (and  later).  It  comprises  the  earliest
toolkits,  ﬂake  and  pebble  tools,  used  by  hominids  (Homo  habilis).
Robust  australopithecines  were  present  at  the  same  time  and  at  the
same sites, however. The simple stone tools were ﬂaked in one or two
directions  and  were  characterized  by  the  production  of  small  ﬂakes
removed from alternate faces along the edge of a cobble. In its pure
form,  hand  axes  are  absent.  Oldowan  tools  were  made  for  nearly 
1 million years before gradual improvements in technique resulted in
a standardized industry known as the Acheulian.

Oligocene: major worldwide division of the Tertiary period that began
about 36.6 million years ago and ended about 23.7 million years ago.
It follows the Eocene epoch and precedes the Miocene epoch. The term
Oligocene is derived from Greek and means the “epoch of few recent
forms,” referring to the sparseness of the number of modern animals
that  originated  during  the  Oligocene.  Many  large  mountain  systems
and  herbivorous  mammals  began  to  develop,  however.  During  this

OMPHALOS

221

epoch, many of the older types of mammals became extinct and the
ﬁrst  apes  appeared.  The  largest  land  mammal  of  all  time,  Baluchi-
therium, is known from Asia, and the ﬁrst mastodons are known from
Egypt.  In  North  America,  primitive  horses  were  evolving,  including
three-toed  forms  such  as  Mesohippus and Miohippus.  Pigs  and  pec-
caries ﬁrst appeared in the early Oligocene of Europe and reached North
America  late  in  the  epoch.  The  earliest  ape-like  form,  Parapithecus,
is known from Oligocene deposits in Egypt, which also have yielded
remains  of  several  kinds  of  Old  World  monkeys.  The  earliest  New
World  monkeys  are  known  from  late  Oligocene  deposits  in  South
America.

olive  jar:  a  type  of  pottery  vessel  used  to  ship  olives  and  wine  (and 
other commodities) from Spain; commonly found in Spanish colonial
archaeological sites.

Olivella:  a  genus  of  marine  univalve  shells  commonly  used  as  raw 
material  for  the  manufacture  of  beads  and  ornaments.  It  is  a  small
spiral shell.

olla: a ceramic vessel generally used to store and cool water – globular-
shaped and narrow-mouthed. It resembled ﬂower pots, but had swelling
sides, ﬂaring necks and rims, and was covered with a lid.

Olmalenge:  Kenyan  Pastoral  Neolithic  pottery  tradition.  There  is  a
northern  facies  in  the  Turkana  region  and  a  southern  facies  in  the
Nakuru Basin. [Nderit ware]

Olmec:  chiefdom-based  civilization,  the  earliest  in  Mesoamerica,  com-
prised of numerous small polities that ﬂourished around the Gulf of
Mexico in central Mexico from about 1200 to 600 bc. All the Olmec
ceremonial  centers  comprised  complexes  of  platforms  supporting 
ceremonial courts, house mounds, stone monuments (including carved
stone  heads,  altars,  and  large  free-standing  sculptures),  and  large 
conical  pyramids.  The  large  stone  heads  are  particularly  distinctive,
up to 3 m (10 feet) tall, and thought to be representations of chiefs
and the elite of Olmec society. Trade was important and again focused
on the ceremonial sites; obsidian, magnetite, serpentine, and mica were
among the materials acquired through exchange. The Olmec style of
art is visible mostly in sculpture and is realistic in its representation
of natural and supernatural forms. Craftsmanship of a very high order
is represented in objects of shell and jadeite.

Oltome: Kenyan Pastoral Neolithic pottery tradition. Kansyore ware may

be a facies/phase.

omphalos:  the  navel  of  the  earth,  marked  by  a  stone  shaped  like  a
Christmas  pudding,  decorated  by  a  network  of  woolen  ribbons  and
located at Delphi in the Temple of Apollo. It supposedly marked the

222

OMPHALOS

exact center of the universe. Omphalos-based jars were ceramic ves-
sels with a prominent hollow dome raised in the base of the pot.

opaline: a ﬁne-grained siliceous rock type widely used for stone artifact
manufacture in the southern African Stone Age. [agat, chalcedony, chert]
open mold: an early and simple mold developed for casting metal tools
and weapons and, later, glass and brick. It consisted of a single block
of stone, or occasionally clay, with the shape of the required artifact
cut into it. Only very simple objects can be cast in this way, especially
when  one  surface  must  be  ﬂat.  The  molds  continued  in  use  after 
more sophisticated versions had been developed, mainly for the manu-
facture of blanks for coins. The molds were probably not technically
open, since this would result in oxidation of the surface of the metal,
so  probably  a  ﬂat  stone  or  other  cover  was  placed  over  the  mold 
during  cooling.  Glass  was  cast  in  open  molds  by  the  Egyptians  as 
early as 5 bc.

open vessel: a vessel with an oriﬁce that is large relative to the vessel’s

height, as is a bowl.

open-work:  decorative  technique  in  which  gaps  or  interstices  are  left
around a pattern, sometimes to be ﬁlled in with a different material.
It  is  also  any  work  constructed  so  as  to  show  openings  through  its
substance; work that is perforated or pierced. [open work]

opposing  pressure  ﬂaking:  in  ﬁnishing  blade  edges,  where  pressure
ﬂakes were removed from each face opposite to each other. [oppos-
ing ﬂaking]

optic  mold:  a  mold  used  to  impart  a  decorative  pattern  to  a  sheet  of
glass, which is then pressed into a contact mold in order to make a
ﬁnished item.

oracle bones: bones (usually shoulder blades) of oxen or tortoise under-
shells used in the Shang culture of northern China for divination. Used
to divine messages from ancestors, they are inscribed with either the
question or answer, and/or the name of the diviner. Oracle bones ordin-
arily record a question addressed by the Shang king to his deceased
ancestors, or the response to the question, or even the ultimate out-
come  of  the  matter  divined.  The  subjects  of  divination  comprise  a 
limited range of royal concerns. The Anyang kings asked chieﬂy about
war, hunting, rainfall, harvests, sickness, their consorts’ childbearing,
the fortune of the coming week, and, above all, sacriﬁces. They ori-
ginated  in  the  Lung-Shun  culture  and  have  been  discovered  at  the
Zhou/Chou  site  of  Qishan  and  the  Shang  site  of  Anyang,  dating  to
the late 2nd millennium bc. Anyang was the last capital of the Shang
dynasty; apart from the far more limited corpus of inscriptions on bronze
ritual vessels, the oracle texts are the only documents left by the Shang
civilization.  The  depressions  were  made  in  bone  and  then  a  heated

ORIFICE

223

point  was  applied  to  cause  the  bone  to  crack.  Divination  was  by 
the  interpretation  of  these  cracks.  The  inscriptions  are  the  earliest 
examples  of  the  fully  developed  form  of  Chinese  characters.  Those 
deciphered  from  Anyang  have  helped  reconstruct  the  Shang  kinship
system  and  aspects  of  the  culture.  These  inscriptions  preserve  the 
earliest  known  Chinese  writing  and  sometimes,  by  naming  kings 
and  ancestors,  conﬁrm  the  historical  basis  of  early  legends.  A  few 
examples have been found at Neolithic sites as Kexingzhuang (Dadunzi).
The  divination  practice  is  called  “scapulimancy”  (scapulae  are 
shoulder blades).

order  of  blows:  evidence  of  the  sequence  in  which  ﬂakes  of  stone 
were removed, explaining the artifact’s pattern of manufacture; as each
successive ﬂake is removed from a piece of stone, its scar encroaches
upon adjacent scars and obliterates portions of earlier ones.

ordering:  arranging  of  artifacts  in  logical  classes  and  in  chronological

order.

organic artifact: artifact made of organic materials – living organisms,
including wood, bone, horn, ﬁber, ivory, or hide. [organic material]
Orientalizing:  period  in  the  8th  and  7th  centuries  bc during  which
Scythian-Iranian  Oriental  objects  with  their  animalistic  motifs  were
spread  and  consequently  imitated  throughout  the  Mediterranean
countries, especially in Greece and Italy. It is also the style of Greek
art  in  that  period,  a  decorative  scheme  found  especially  on  pottery.
The  style  was  probably  the  result  of  renewed  contact  with  Syria,
Phoenicia, and Egypt. It is an art history term used of various periods
and cultures in antiquity when a “western” production showed evid-
ence  of  inﬂuence  from  the  Near,  Middle,  or  Far  East.  An  example 
would be the borrowing by Greek black-ﬁgure painters of numerous
abstract, vegetable, and animal motifs from Syrian and Phoenician art.
From  about  650 bc on,  the  Greeks  began  to  visit  Egypt  regularly, 
and  their  observation  of  the  monumental  stone  buildings  there  was
the genesis of the ultimate development of monumental architecture
and sculpture in Greece. The Egyptians executed such monuments in
hard stone instead of the limestone, clay, or wood to which the Greeks
had been accustomed. The Greeks learned the techniques of handling
the harder stone in Egypt, and at home they turned to the ﬁne white
marble of the Cyclades islands (Paros, Naxos) for their materials. It
was  at  this  time  that  the  ﬁrst  truly  monumental  examples  of  Greek
sculpture  appeared.  The  period  in  Greece  continued  through  the 
7th century bc and saw the rise of narrative in Greek art. [orientalizing]
orientation: the way an artifact is positioned for illustration, according

to its type and attributes.

oriﬁce: mouth or opening, usually at the top, of a vessel.

224

ORRERY

orrery: an apparatus that illustrates the relative positions and motions
of bodies in the solar system by rotation and revolution of balls moved
by wheelwork, sometimes incorporated in a clock.

orthographic  projection:  a  way  of  depicting  an  object  graphically, 
similar to a perspective view but with lines that would be parallel on
the object shown parallel on the paper.

Oseberg ship: important Viking ship burial, discovered in 1903 in south
Norway in a peat mound. It was found with most of its timbers intact
and its main burial chamber still ﬁlled with most of its contents. Among
the objects in the chamber were the skeletons of a man (c. ad 850–
900), dogs and horses, a chest containing oil lamps and personal items,
a  wooden  bed,  and  a  sledge.  Now  reconstructed  in  the  Oslo  Ship
Museum, the Oseberg ship is a ﬁne example of a large sophisticated
Viking warship. The ship itself was plank-built and had a pronounced
keel, a large mast, and a beautifully carved stern. It shed much light
on the everyday life of Vikings.

ossuary: a charnel house used for multiple, mainly secondary, inhuma-
tions; the name for a sarcophagus of earthenware, stone, or marble,
in which the vessel containing the cremated ashes of the dead was placed.
It may be either a small portable article for a single interment (larnax,
pithos, urn) or a cave or built structure to take a number of burials
(chamber tomb, tholos). [ossarium, ossuarium, osteotheke]

Ostionoid: one of three associated ceramic series in the Greater Antilles
area. Seen as transitional to the Chicoid and Meillacoid, the Ostionoid
appears in c. ad 650 in Puerto Rico, where it overlays Saladoid mater-
ials.  Vessels  are  generally  smooth,  ﬁnished  in  red  monochrome  slip,
and often with plain tabular lugs. The introduction of items like petal-
loid celts, potter stamps, and zemis indicates external inﬂuences, pos-
sibly Mesoamerican. Agriculture activity is indicated by the presence
of griddles used in the preparation of manioc. [Ostiones]

ostrakon:  a  potsherd  or,  more  rarely,  a  ﬂake  of  stone,  bearing  an
inscription in ink or paint. In Greece they were employed for voting;
in Egypt for memoranda, business accounts, writing exercises, jottings,
artist’s sketches, and listmaking. They commonly consisted of personal
jottings,  letters,  sketches,  or  scribal  exercises,  but  were  also  often
inscribed  with  literary  texts.  They  could  also  be  fragments  from
inscribed jars (e.g., a wine jar inscribed with the details of a vintage).
Ostraka are known from all periods, but 19th- and 20th-dynasty exam-
ples are commonest in Egypt (up to 20,000 have been found). Most
of the Egyptian examples are in hieratic or demotic, but there are also
cursive hieroglyphic texts and numerous pictures, including drafts of
hieroglyphic  inscriptions.  The  term  is  derived  from  the  Classical
Greek voting practice of ostrakismos (“ostracism”), a 5th-century bc

OXFORDSHIRE  WARE

225

political move in which each citizen could write upon a potsherd the
name of someone whom he wished to see banished. If sufﬁcient votes
were cast against one person (the number seems to have been 6000),
the  person  named  would  be  banished  for  10  years.  The  usage  of
inscribed sherds seems to have spread to Egypt with the Greek con-
quest. Ostraka from the New Kingdom are especially numerous. Deir
el-Medina’s  ostraka  are  a  great  source  of  evidence  for  the  life  of  its
villages and communities. [ostracon; ostraca, ostraka (pl.)]

ostrich eggshell: shells of ostrich eggs were sometimes used as containers
for water and pigments like ocher and specularite. Fragments were also
made into beads by Later Stone Age people in southern and East Africa.
They  were  sometimes  decorated  with  incisions  and  are  often  found
buried near springs and streams. Fragments have been found at Middle
and Later Stone Age sites; the earliest 14,000-year-old fragments were
found at Boomplaas Cave in South Africa.

Otley-type ware: a late Saxon wheel-thrown pottery c. ad 850–1150 of

Yorkshire and the north midlands of England.

Otranto mosaic: a Romanesque cathedral in Apulia, southeastern Italy,
with a mosaic pavement covering the nave and aisles. Laid between
1163  and  1166,  it  was  designed  by  a  priest  named  Pantaleon  and 
shows certain similarities to the Bayeux Tapestry. The central theme
is the history of the universe. Similar mosaics existed at other Apulian
Romanesque cathedrals, but this splendid work is the only one to have
survived.

Otter Creek point: large, bifacially worked, chipped stone projectile points
with a side notch, from the Archaic stage in northeastern North America,
c. 4500–2600 bc.

Ounan point: pointed bladelet with a basal stem used in the North African
late  Pleistocene  and  Holocene,  such  as  in  Ounanian,  and  early
Neolithic industries of the eastern Sahara. [Ounanian point]

outline: a key and obvious diagnostic feature is the outline or silhouette
of the implement. The outline is the two-dimensional image perceived
when  viewing  the  outer  perimeter  of  an  artifact  with  a  blade  face
towards the viewer. Some projectile point types have distinctive out-
lines and can be accurately identiﬁed by this singular feature.

ovate: a reﬁned Acheulian biface with an egg-shaped outline and a ﬂat
or twisted proﬁle; some have a tranchet ﬁnish. [ovate projectile point]
ovoid:  of  a  solid  or  three-dimensional  surface,  egg-shaped;  of  a  plane

ﬁgure, oval, especially with one end more pointed than the other.

Oxfordshire ware: a type of pottery in a variety of fabrics, made around
Oxford, England, important around the 4th century ad, and includ-
ing distinctive types of mortaria, parchment ware, and red-color-coated
ware in the Samian tradition.

226

OX-HIDE  INGOT

ox-hide ingot: a copper or tin ingot shaped like a stretched ox hide, from

the Mediterranean in the Early Bronze Age.

oxidized: a pottery fabric ﬁred in an oxidizing atmosphere with abundant
oxygen available to form red hematite from the iron in the clay fabric
or in pigments. [oxidized ware]

oxidizing  atmosphere:  a  term  used  in  relation  to  pottery  technology,
describing certain ﬁring conditions involving a gaseous atmosphere in
which an oxidation reaction (the oxidation of solids) occurs. If a kiln
is being ﬁred with good, dry fuel and with plenty of draft, the carbon
in  the  fuel  is  converted  into  carbon  dioxide,  and  there  is  oxygen  in
the atmosphere. This is the oxidizing atmosphere that causes pottery
to be ﬁred to a red or orange color whether it has a slip or not. The
opposite phenomenon, a reducing atmosphere, produces black pottery.
Much pottery, however, varies in color over its surface caused by chang-
ing conditions during the ﬁring process. [oxidation]

ox-scapula shovel: a digging implement made of the shoulder blade of
an  ox  or  large  cow,  of  Neolithic  and  Early  Bronze  Age  sites  in  the
British Isles, usually in association with antler picks and antler rakes.
Oxus Treasure: a collection of Persian art of the Achaemenidian period
(6th to 4th century bc) now in the British Museum, London. It was
discovered  in  1877  on  the  bank  of  the  Oxus  River  near  the  present
Afghanistan–Russian border. This large hoard of gold and silver metal-
work  included  a  variety  of  jewelry,  ornamental  plaques,  ﬁgurines, 
chariot models, and vessels. One of the armlets consists of a circular
gold  band  with  its  two  ends  meeting  in  the  form  of  ﬁnely  worked
grifﬁns.

P

pack rat midden: any collection of artifacts or objects concealed at some
point by a pack rat (also wood or trade rat) and remaining in an assembl-
age at that location. They are so-called because the rats collect vari-
ous bits of material to deposit in their dens. They sometimes pick up
shiny objects in camps and may at the same time leave something they
were  carrying,  thus  giving  the  impression  that  they  are  trading  one
item for the other.

paddle-and-anvil: a pottery-making method in which a wooden paddle
and  a  stone  or  ceramic  disk  are  used  to  smooth  and  shape  a  coiled
pot. The paddle was used to strike the exterior surface of the vessel
as  a  convex  stone  or  clay  anvil  was  held  against  the  corresponding
interior surface. [paddle and anvil, paddle-and-anvil technique]

padlock:  a  detachable  lock  hanging  by  a  pivoted  hook  on  the  object 

fastened.

Paestan pottery: south Italian pottery made at Paestum, some signed by

the craftsmen, starting in the mid 4th century bc.

Paffrath ware: hard-ﬁred ware with a black ﬁnish, made from the 10th
to  11th  centuries  until  the  13th  century  at  Paffrath,  near  Cologne,
Germany.  The  best-known  products  of  this  center  are  the  so-called
handled ladles – small cooking pots or bowls with a curved handle.
Paiján  point:  a  type  of  bifacially  worked,  chipped  stone  point  with  a 
triangular outline and small stem or tang at the base, of the Archaic
stage Paiján tradition of South America c. 9000–7000 bc.

paint: a material applied to the surface of another material in a layer,
to  color  it.  It  is  usually  a  pigment  containing  a  coloring  agent  and
sometimes organic substances to make it easier to brush and ensure
that it adheres.

painted glass: glass that has been colored and decorated by painting.

228

PAINTED  GRAY  WARE

Painted  Gray  ware:  a  pottery  type  characteristic  of  Iron  Age  sites  in 
northern  India,  with  its  center  of  distribution  in  the  eastern  Punjab
and central Ganges Valley. It was a ﬁne, wheelmade, thin-walled ware
with  a  gray  surface  decorated  with  simple  designs  of  circles  and
pothooks, made before 500 bc. The designs were in red or black paint.
The forms that occur most frequently are a shallow dish and a deeper
bowl. It occurs in deposits of the later 2nd millennium and early 1st mil-
lennium bc. Many authorities believe that Painted Gray ware was the
pottery used by the early Aryans in India. [Painted Grey ware]

painting: artwork ﬁrst found on rocks in Europe and Africa, created with
charcoal,  lime,  and  iron  oxide  of  various  colors  mixed  with  animal
fat or marrow. European paintings are found in caves and date back
to  early  Aurignacian  times,  80,000–70,000 bc;  if  created  purely  for
art, though, they would not have been done in the depths of the cave.
It is thought that they must have been of religious, magical, or ritual
signiﬁcance. There is proof that schools of painting were held in some
caves. Polychrome paintings were made at the peak of Paleolithic art,
mid-Magdalenian times, about 10,000 bc.

Paleocene epoch: the earliest geological epoch and division of the Tertiary
period,  beginning  about  66.4  million  years  ago  and  lasting  about 
8.6 million years (c. 65–55 million years ago). It precedes the Eocene
epoch and follows the Cretaceous period. During this epoch, there was
major development of primitive mammals. The earliest-known primates
date from the Paleocene. [Palaeocene]

Paleogene: lower division of the Tertiary system including the Paleocene,
Eocene, and Oligocene periods, lasting about 42.7 million years. It is
the older of the two stratigraphic divisions of the Cenozoic era (which
began about 66.4 million years ago and extends to the present) and
was followed by the Neogene period. The term Paleogene, which means
“ancient born,” was devised in Europe to emphasize the similarity of
marine  fossils  found  in  rocks  of  the  ﬁrst  three  Cenozoic  epochs,  as
opposed  to  the  later  fossils  of  the  Neogene  period.  In  North  Amer-
ica,  the  terms  Paleogene  and  Neogene  are  not  widely  used,  and  the
Cenozoic is divided only into the Tertiary period (c. 66.4 million to
1.6 million years ago) and the Quaternary period (c. 1.6 million years
ago  to  present).  Thus,  the  Paleogene  period  may  also  be  considered
to be roughly equivalent to the ﬁrst two-thirds of the Tertiary period.
[Palaeogene]

Paleoindian: 1. One of the prehistoric people who migrated from Asia
and  settled  throughout  the  Americas  no  later  than  10,000 bc.  They
existed as big-game hunters from about 10,000 bc to about 6000 bc
in the Great Plains and eastern North America. (The other tradition
at the time was the Desert-culture peoples of the western basin range

PALEOLITHIC

229

region.)  Some  regard  the  term  as  referring  to  all  hunting  groups
involved  with  now-extinct  mammals,  in  which  case  the  peoples 
who hunted the species of bison that became extinct about 4500 bc
would  also  be  classiﬁed  as  Paleoindians.  The  oldest  remains  of  the
Paleoindian tradition are found on sites where large Pleistocene mam-
mals were killed and butchered. The most distinctive artifact type of
this  horizon  is  the  Clovis  ﬂuted  projectile  point,  which  was  accom-
panied by side scrapers. Paleoindians were most frequently associated
with  mammoth,  although  associations  with  extinct  species  of  bison,
horse,  and  camel  have  also  been  reported.  2.  The  earliest  period  in
New World chronology, representing the time up to the development
of agriculture and villages. 3. In yet another sense, it refers to the period
in  archaeology  (also  called  Early  Lithic)  beginning  with  the  earliest
stone  tools,  about  750,000  years  ago.  [Palaeo-Indian,  Palaeoindian,
Paleo-Indian]

Paleolithic:  more  technical  name  for  the  Old  Stone  Age,  a  division 
of  prehistory  covering  the  time  from  the  ﬁrst  use  of  stone  tools  by
humans,  c.  2.5  million  years  ago,  to  the  retreat  of  the  glacial  ice  in
the northern hemisphere, c. 10,000–8500 bc. It began in the Pliocene
epoch  and  was  followed  by  the  Mesolithic.  It  is  the  Old  World 
equivalent, although with a much greater extension back in time, of
the  Paleoindian  or  Early  Lithic  stage  of  New  World  development. 
The Paleolithic was characterized by the making of chipped or ﬂaked
stone  tools  and  weapons  and  by  a  hunting  and  food-gathering  way
of life. It is usually divided into Lower, Middle, and Upper (or Late)
Paleolithic  –  mainly  based  on  artifact  typology.  The  subdivisions 
are characterized as: Lower Paleolithic, c. 2.5 million to 200,000 bc,
with the earliest forms of human (Australopithecus and Homo erectus),
and  the  predominance  of  core  tools  of  pebble  tool,  hand-ax,  and 
chopper  type;  Middle  Paleolithic,  c.  150,000–40,000 bc,  the  era  of
Neanderthals  and  the  predominance  of  ﬂake-tool  industries  (e.g.,
Mousterian)  over  most  of  Eurasia;  and  Upper  Paleolithic  (starting 
perhaps as early as 38,000 bc to c. 10,000 bc), with Homo sapiens
sapiens,  blade-and-burin  industries,  and  the  development  of  cave 
art  in  western  Europe.  During  this  stage,  people  colonized  the  New
World and Australia. The main Paleolithic cultures of Europe were,
in chronological order: the Pre-Abbevillian, Abbevillian, Clactonian,
Acheulian,  Levalloisian,  Mousterian,  Aurignacian,  Solutrean,  and
Magdalenian. The term was introduced in 1865 by John Lubbock in
Prehistoric Times (5th edn, 1990). The Paleolithic was originally deﬁned
by the use of chipped stone tools, but later an economic criterion was
added and the practice of hunting and gathering is now regarded as
a deﬁning characteristic. [Palaeolithic]

PALEOLITHIC  ART

Paleolithic art: art of the last ice age. It is divided into: (1) portable or
mobiliary art; (2) deep engravings or bas-reliefs on large stones; and
(3)  cave  art  or  parietal  art.  Portable  or  mobiliary  art  is  know  in  a
variety of forms from Spain to Siberia; engravings are found mainly
in southwestern France; and cave art in France, Italy, and Sapin. Art
of similar antiquity is known on other continents. [Palaeolithic art]

Paleozoic:  major  interval  of  geological  time  extending  from  540  to 
245 million years ago. It is the ﬁrst era of the Phanerozoic eon. It is
a geological era in the Earth’s history before the Mesozoic and after
the  Precambrian,  marked  by  the  development  of  ﬁshes,  land  plants,
insects, reptiles, and fern-like trees. The Early Paleozoic (probably the
ﬁrst 130 million years) was characterized by widespread ups and downs
of the Earth’s crust, which resulted in mountain building and geosyn-
clines (downward ﬂexing) in parts of North America, Europe, and Asia.
Great seas were formed in the southern areas of the emergent land-
masses. Much of North America was covered by a warm shallow sea
with many coral reefs. The Late Paleozoic, which extended from about
410  to  245  million  years  ago,  saw  tremendous  changes  wrought  in
the  Earth.  Both  plant  and  animal  life  ﬂourished  in  the  great,  warm,
shallow  seas,  and  the  various  convolutions  of  the  Earth  laid  down 
extensive mineral deposits. Much of the copper, gold, lead, zinc, and
other minerals mined today derive from Devonian times in the Late
Paleozoic.  Huge  swampy  forest  regions  covered  much  of  the  north-
ern  continents,  and  these  were  repeatedly  and  suddenly  invaded  by
the seas, which buried the vegetation, then covered it with silt. When
the sea subsequently withdrew, the forests revived and were again buried
in rhythmic cycles that are now evident in deposits called cyclothems.
Heat and pressure transformed the buried vegetation into oil and coal.
During the Devonian period animal life emerged from the ocean, and
various species adapted themselves to breathing air and moving about
on land. This happened by way of the amphibians, which evolved in
the Carboniferous and Permian periods, and were succeeded by rep-
tiles.  The  Late  Paleozoic  also  saw  the  beginning  of  insect  life  –  and
ﬁshes and land plants underwent rapid development. [Palaeozoic]

Palermo  Stone:  a  slab  of  black  basalt  bearing  a  record  of  the  ﬁrst 
ﬁve Egyptian dynasties (Old Kingdom), compiled in the 5th dynasty,
c.  2400 bc.  It  is  one  of  the  basic  sources  of  information  about  the
chronology and cultural history of Egypt during the ﬁrst ﬁve dynasties
(c. 2925–2325 bc). Named for the Sicilian city in which one slab is
stored, the diorite stela is one of six existing fragments that probably
originally stood in Egyptian temples; other slabs are now in London
and Cairo. It is inscribed on both sides with horizontal lines of hiero-
glyphic text, the top row listing the names of predynastic rulers. The

PAN

231

following rows, each headed by the name of a different king, are divided
into compartments, each compartment signifying 1 year. Within the
compartments the hieroglyphs always list one or more memorable events
of that year. Thus the original monument was apparently a year-by-
year record of all the kings from the 1st to 5th dynasty, although the
last name preserved on the stone is that of Neferirkare, the third of
the nine kings of the 5th dynasty.

palette:  a  small  slab  of  stone  for  grinding  and  mixing  substances  like
paint or cosmetics. A series from early Egypt, such as that of Narmer,
is important since the relief decoration provides valuable evidence on
the art and history of the country at the beginning of dynastic times,
c. 3000 bc. The term is also used to describe scribal palettes. Cosmetic/
ceremonial palettes were usually of siltstone (greywacke) and are found
amongst  grave  goods  as  early  as  the  Badarian  period  (c.  5500–
4000 bc). Scribal palettes, long rectangular pieces of wood or stone
(averaging 30 cm long, 6 cm wide (12 by 2.5 inches)), had a shallow
central groove or slot to hold reed brushes or pens and circular depres-
sions for cakes of pigment. The order of colors was white, then the
yellows, reds, blues, and black.

palimpsest:  1.  A  collection  of  archaeological  artifacts,  ecofacts,  and 
material that may not be related – that are together through accident
or due to natural forces rather than human activity. 2. A site with a
mass of intercut features of different periods.

palm cup: a Saxon glass vessel shaped like a hemispherical bowl with a

wide everted rim, c. ad 400–700.

palmate stone: a large spatulate stone object about 61 cm (2 feet) long,
shaped like a hand with extended ﬁngers, believed to be a ceremonial
representation of a device worn by ballgame players in Mesoamerica
and dating to the Classic period. It rested on a yoke which ﬁtted around
the waist and projected upward to protect the chest. Probably of wood
or leather with carving on both sides, they may have been trophies,
religious symbols, or for burial purposes. The center for these puzzl-
ing stone carvings seems to be the coastal Veracruz area. [palma]

palmette: a decorative motif suggestive of a palm; a stylized palm frond

used to decorate Greek and Roman art.

palstave:  a  Middle  Bronze  Age  form  of  ax  with  side  ﬂanges,  stop-bar
(or  stop-ridge),  and  sometimes  one  or  (rarely)  two  loops  attached, 
and found in Europe. Its features made for more secure hafting of the
ax blade by preventing lateral movement and haft splitting. This develop-
ment led to the socketed ax. The palstave was used by the Celtic nations
in war for battering the armor of the enemy.

pan:  a  metal  (or  other  material)  container  for  cooking  food  in  or  for 

rituals.

232

PAN  PIPE

pan pipe: an instrument composed of several pipes in which air is made

to vibrate by blowing across the top edge. [panpipe]

Panaramitee style: an art style found in many parts of Australia involv-
ing rock engravings featuring circles and tridents (possibly kangaroo
and  emu  tracks)  and  dating  to  Pleistocene  times.  It  is  found  at
Panaramitee in the Flinder Ranges, south Australia, and arid regions
in  south  Australia,  New  South  Wales,  north  Queensland,  and  the
Northern Territory; isolated examples have also been found in north-
ern Tasmania and near Sydney. Engravings were found at Ingaladdi
dating to 7000–5000 bp, at Early Man Shelter dating to c. 13,000 bp,
and at Karolta about 30,000 years old. The style involves the peck-
ing  on  rock  surfaces  by  indirect  percussion,  clusters  of  hundreds  of
small ﬁgures, usually about 10 cm (4 inches) tall, in outline or inﬁlled
forms. The designs include dots, spirals, mazes, and crescents, human
footprints,  lizards,  radiating  lines,  and  tectiforms  (roof  shapes).  The
art is thought to be of considerable antiquity on the basis of still incon-
clusive  evidence  of  patination,  distribution  in  both  Australia  and
Tasmania, and the absence of stone tool types belonging to the post-
2000 bc Australian Small Tool tradition. [Panaramitee art]

pancheon: a large shallow bowl for letting liquids stand.
panpipe lug: a type of handle found on Neolithic pottery of the Chassey,
Cortaillod,  and  Lagozza  cultures  in  France,  Switzerland,  and  north-
ern Italy. It consisted of cylindrical vertical lugs placed side by side,
thus slightly resembling the panpipe. The panpipe, a wind instrument,
was widespread in Neolithic and later cultures, especially in Melanesia
and pre-Columbian South America. [ﬂûte de Pan, pan-pipe lug]

Pantano  Longarini:  a  large  wreck  of  5th  to  7th  century  date  found  in
the  sea  off  Pantano  Longarini  in  southeast  Sicily.  The  vessel  would
have been about 45 m long and 9 m wide (148 by 30 feet); the struc-
tural  details  of  the  boat  have  contributed  to  the  study  of  Byzantine
ship building.

pantile: curved, interlocking roof tile of S-shaped section usually made

of clay or concrete.

paper: a thin vegetable-based sheet used for writing, drawing, printing, etc.
papyrus:  a  reed  of  the  sedge  family  growing  in  Mediterranean  lands, 
particularly  Egypt  along  the  banks  of  the  Nile;  the  ﬂexible  writing 
material produced from the plant. An inexpensive writing material was
created by splitting and opening out the stems, laying them together
in two layers at right angles to each other, then beating them together,
thus activating the plant’s natural starch to form an adhesive. Examples
preserved by the dry climate of Egypt and other regions in tombs, caves,
etc., have yielded invaluable evidence on the ancient history of the area.
Papyrus is the Latin form, from which our word “paper” derives. Its

stems were also bound together in bundles together to make lightweight
boats. Used ﬁrst in Egypt, it later replaced clay tablets in the Near East
when  the  Aramaic  alphabet  replaced  the  cuneiform  script.  Unlike
engraved  clay  tablets,  papyrus  allowed  a  light,  cursive  script,  thus 
encouraging the spread of a technique that was originally very restricted
and  specialized.  The  earliest  papyrus  dates  to  the  1st  dynasty,  the 
latest to the Islamic period, when the plant died out in Egypt.

papyrus column: 1. In Egyptian religion, an amulet that conveyed fresh-
ness,  youth,  vigor,  and  the  continuance  of  life  to  its  wearer.  2.  The
name  of  the  mighty  columns  erected  at  Karnak,  134  in  total,  12  of
which formed the higher central aisle (23 m or 76 feet in height) of
the hypostyle hall.

paradigmatic  classiﬁcation:  a  type  of  systematics  that  employs  a  pre-
conceived set of classes deﬁned by the intersection of dimensions or
attributes. Classiﬁcation is based on an equal weighting of attributes,
so  that  each  class  is  deﬁned  by  a  cluster  of  unique  attributes  and  is
not dependent on the order in which the attributes were deﬁned.

parallel ﬂaking: a secondary ﬂaking technique that is often found on the
earliest projectile points and stone tools, usually performed on the blade
faces, in which the removal of ﬂakes was performed in such a man-
ner  as  to  remove  ﬂakes  of  similar  size,  depth,  length,  and  direction
and resulted in parallel ﬂake scars. Typically, they are the mark of a
well accomplished ﬂint knapper. Such ﬂake scars are found on only
a  few  specimens  and  can  be  quite  aesthetically  beautiful  to  behold.
[collateral ﬂaking]

parchment: writing material made from the skin of calves, sheep, or goats,
which gradually replaced papyrus during the late Roman Empire, result-
ing in the book (codex) replacing the scroll. The name apparently derives
from the ancient Greek city of Pergamum (in Turkey), where parch-
ment  is  said  to  have  been  invented  in  the  2nd  century  bc.  It  is  less
fragile, and could also be reused after the original text had been erased
by scraping (called palimpsests). The ﬁner kind of parchment known
as vellum is from the skins of calves, kids, and dead-born lambs. In
the 4th century ad, vellum or parchment as a material and the codex
as a form became dominant, although there are later examples of rolls,
and papyrus was occasionally used for ofﬁcial documents until the 10th
century. Paper then took over from the 14th century.

parchment  ware:  a  type  of  tableware  in  pale  fabrics  with  simple  red-
brown painted decoration, mostly bowls, from Britain in the 3rd and
4th centuries ad.

Parian marble: a marble quarried from the island of Paros, Greece that
is white, close-grained, and very suitable for sculpture. It was used by
the leading sculptors of the Mediterranean world.

PARIETAL  ART

parietal art: literally “art on walls,” a term used to designate art on the
walls of caves and shelters, extended to cover art on any nonmovable
surface (large rocks, blocks, ceilings, ﬂoors).

paring chisel: a tool of stone or metal with a shaped narrow blade that
could be used carefully to remove thin strips or shavings when fash-
ioning wood.

Parisian ware: a thin, dark gray, highly burnished ware decorated with
impressed  stamps,  mainly  of  Yorkshire  and  Lincolnshire,  Britain, 
c. late 1st and 2nd centuries ad.

parrot beak jug: a type of glazed ceramic jug with a stylized polychrome
image of a large-beaked bird on the side, from Britain and northern
Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries ad.

partially cortical ﬂake: a ﬂake possessing some cortex on its dorsal aspect.

[secondary ﬂake]

parting  agent:  a  material  like  sand,  ash,  or  dry  clay,  sprinkled  over  a

mold or working surface to prevent wet clay from sticking.

parting vessel: a container, usually square or rectangular, used in metal pro-
cessing for separating metals one from another – usually silver from gold.
paste: the clay substance of pottery excluding temper/ﬁller additives. [body,

fabric, ware]

paste texture: in ceramic analysis, the appearance of the ceramic paste

as determined by clay particle size.

Patch Grove ware: pottery type with a rough gray core and an orange or
brown surface, usually wide-mouthed storage jars with notched shoulder
decoration. The pottery is from northwest Kent and Surrey, England,
into the 2nd century ad.

patera:  in  Roman  antiquity,  a  rounded  bowl,  often  of  bronze,  usually
with a long handle and used for pouring libations. The dish was also
used in sacriﬁces.

patina:  outermost  layer  of  an  artifact,  which  may  differ  in  color,  tex-
ture,  luster,  or  substance  from  the  inner  part  of  the  artifact  due 
to physical, biological, or chemical alterations due to environmental
conditions. The term also refers to any thin, colored ﬁlm or layer formed
on the surface of ﬂint or other rocks as a result of alkaline conditions.
It is a porous bluish or white weathering; possibly becoming stained
with  brown  or  yellow  due  to  contacts  with  iron  compounds  in 
percolating water. Similarly, the green patina on bronze objects is a 
product of corrosion. The amount of patination is sometimes used as
a very rough indication of age; the longer the exposure, the deeper the
patination. [patination]

patination:  the  altered  surface  and  coloring  of  an  artifact  made  by 

natural weathering or exposure to soil acids.

pattern: any design with regularly repeated parts. [symmetry]

PEGGED  SPEARHEAD

235

patterns of discard: a term referring to remains left for investigation after
natural destructive forces have affected artifacts and food stuffs aban-
doned by their original users.

patu: a Polynesian/Maori short, clublike weapon, made of a variety of
materials including wood, bone, stone, and whalebone (paroa). Finds
on the Society Islands that are similar to the Maori patu suggest they
may have been part of the early Eastern Polynesian assemblage of New
Zealand’s ﬁrst settlers.

pearlware: a form of earthenware, developed by Wedgwood (1775–79)
as a whiter version of the creamware body. A greater quantity of white
clay was used in the body and the transparent lead glaze included traces
of cobalt, giving the surface a pearly-white appearance. It was soon
adopted by other potteries, such as Spode, Leeds, and Swansea.

pebble  tool:  a  simple  form  of  stone  cutting  tool,  the  oldest  type  of 
tool  made  by  forerunners  of  modern  humans.  The  tool  consisted  of
a rounded stone that had been struck a number of blows with a sim-
ilar stone used as a pounder, which created a serrated crest that served
as a chopping blade. The core is only slightly altered by striking off
a few small ﬂakes. The most typical are choppers and chopping tools.
These tools could be used as crude hunting knives, to grub roots, and
for other purposes. The oldest examples are perhaps 2–2.5 million years
old, from sites like the Omo Valley and Hadar in Ethiopia. Those found
in  large  numbers  in  Olduvai  Gorge,  Tanganyika,  are  universally
accepted as eoliths, dating back man’s history to 1,000,000 years ago.
By a process of reﬁnement these pebble tools developed into the hand
axes  of  Africa,  Europe,  and  southwest  Asia,  and  into  the  chopping
tools of the Far East. [pebble chopper]

pecking: a technique of shaping, or producing a design on, stone by ham-
mering. The surface is crushed, usually with a stone hammer, and the
dusty fragments swept aside. Incising or pecking designs into rock was
practiced by Native American peoples.

pecking and grinding: the process of manufacturing heavy-duty stone tools
(bowls, mauls, etc.) from granular rocks by prolonged hammering with
a hammerstone. Abrasive techniques might be used to ﬁnish the piece.
pectoral: a plate forming the front of a cuirass which covers the chest.
pedestal:  a  free-standing  raised  plinth  or  bollard;  also  an  architectural
support or base, as for a column or statue or in the bottom of a kiln.
pedestal beaker:  type  of  drinking  cup  with  a  deﬁnitive  base  section  or

foot, from Britain or Gallo-Belgic areas.

pegged  spearhead:  a  socketed  spearhead  of  the  European  Late  Bronze
Age, with the shaft secured to the metal head by a metal or wooden
peg set at right angles to the main axis of the shaft, passing through
a pair of opposed holes in the metal casing of the socket.

236

PELIKE

pelike: in Greek antiquity, a large wine container with two vertical handles
– a type of amphora where the greatest diameter was below mid-point.
It was probably used at a symposium.

penannular: a term referring to an artifact in the form of a ring, but with
a  small  break  at  one  point,  used  particularly  for  forms  of  brooches
and torcs. The penannular brooch was characteristic of Irish produc-
tion. It was generally of great size and probably worn on the shoulder
with the pin pointing upward, and was decorated with interlaced pat-
terns. It was the most common type of dress fastener of the sub-Roman
period and remained popular in Celtic regions of Britain up until the
10th century. Developed out of earlier Iron Age and Roman brooch
forms, penannular brooches comprise an open hoop with two termi-
nals and a pin backing the hoop. The terminals in particular were often
ornamented, some very elaborately. There is an extensive typology for
these  ornaments,  and  they  vary  in  appearance  from  plain  bronze  or
iron rings to elaborately inlaid and gilded examples such as the Tara
Brooch, which was made around ad 700 in Ireland. [penannular brooch]
pendant: an adornment that hangs from a piece of jewelry (necklace or

earring).

penknife point: type of late Upper Paleolithic ﬂint tool found in north-
west Europe. Made on fairly broad blades, these tools are character-
ized by a straight unworked edge along one side, a curved distal end,
and a lightly retouched edge parallel to the unworked side.

percussion cap: a small amount of explosive powder contained in metal
or  paper  and  exploded  by  striking;  used  especially  in  toy  guns  and
formerly in some ﬁrearms.

percussion technique: any of the methods used to strike a ﬂake from a
core  in  the  making  of  stone  tools;  the  reduction  of  a  stone  core  by
hitting it with a hammerstone or bone. This ﬂaking technique usually
left a hinge or step fracture. Direct percussion is hitting a core with
a hammer. Indirect percussion uses a punch between the core and the
hammer.  Anvil  percussion  (block  on  block)  is  the  striking  of  a  core
against a ﬁxed hardstone anvil. Bipolar percussion involves resting the
core on an anvil and striking it with a hammer, making a ﬂake with
a bulb of percussion on each end. [percussion, percussion ﬂaking, per-
cussion method]

percussor: a hammerstone, bone, etc. used to strike a stone in the per-

cussion technique.

perforation: a hole or series of holes punched or bored through some-

thing, especially a hole in a series.

periglacial: a term describing cold climate processes and landforms – an
environment  with  severe  frost  in  nonglacial  conditions  and  with
much  ground  ice,  mass  movements,  and  strong  winds.  It  applies  to

Pendant

PETERBOROUGH  WARE

237

the region surrounding a glacial area and regions immediately beyond
the ice-front during a glaciation. In a periglacial zone, part of the ground
is  perennially  frozen.  This  so-called  permafrost  layer  is  covered  by 
a  layer  which  thaws  and  freezes  seasonally,  the  active  layer.  Such 
seasonal  changes  give  rise  to  several  processes,  some  of  which  sort 
the constituents of the active layer and are collectively known as cryo-
turbation. A variety of landforms, including involutions, ice wedges,
and pingos, are formed in the active layer and permafrost. Hill slopes
become  mantled  with  frost-shattered  rubble  that  moves  downslope 
during cycles of freezing and thawing. Rivers are usually seasonal in
the  periglacial  zone,  and  erosion  by  frost  action  is  dominant.  Wind
erosion  and  deposition  is  often  an  important  factor,  and  caused  the
formation of the huge deposits of loess and cover-sands in Europe and
Asia.  The  periglacial  zone  is  of  interest  because  it  would  have  been
the environment in which man lived for long periods of time during
the Devensian/Weichselian cold stage. During the coldest periods of the
Quaternary (the last 1,600,000 years), the periglacial zone was enlarged
to approximately twice its present size.

period: any speciﬁc interval of time in the archaeological record, such as
the Upper Paleolithic period. This term is often confusingly used inter-
changeably with phase and stage. A period is a true time division of
the history of a large region (such as the Valley of Mexico or southern
China) and does not necessarily imply any developmental character-
istics.  In  an  archaeological  context,  it  is  a  major  unit  of  prehistoric
time, usually containing several phases and pertaining to a wide area.
It is a convenient term used to discuss the history of a complex area.
peripheral chopper: a pebble tool worked on both faces and often irre-
gular in shape. The cutting edge can go around the periphery or there
may be a break; it can also be planoconvex in section. It differs from
a biface in that it is often not axially symmetrical and in the undiffer-
entiated position of the cutting edge. It is characteristic of the Oldowan
and Acheulian complexes.

perishable: any artifact made from organic materials that ordinarily would
decay but for some reason was preserved. Such artifacts include bas-
ketry, cordage, and leather.

pernette: small terra cotta tripod used to stack vases in the kiln so as to

prevent them sticking to one another during ﬁring.

pestle: club-shaped (oblong cylindrical or subcylindrical) implement of stone

used for pounding, crushing, or grinding substances in a mortar.

Peterborough  ware:  a  poorly  made,  elaborately  decorated  pottery  of 
the British Late Neolithic, found in southern England. The ornament
consists  of  pits,  bone,  and  wooden  stick  impressions  and  “maggot”
patterns made by impressing a bit of whipped cord into the soft clay.

PETERBOROUGH  WARE

The earliest (Ebbsﬂeet) substyle developed from Grimston-Lyles Hill
ware  c.  3500 bc and  consisted  of  round-based  vessels  with  fairly
restrained  ornament.  The  later  variants  have  more  complicated 
decoration  and  show  the  inﬂuence  of  Beaker  pottery:  the  second
(Mortlake) substyle still occurs on round-based vessels, but in the ﬁnal
(Fengate) substyle the pots are ﬂat-bottomed and have many features
which lead on to the collared urns of the Bronze Age. These vessels
were probably intended for everyday domestic use.

petit-tranchet  arrowhead: a  Late  Mesolithic  western  European  ﬂint
arrow tip with a blade broken into trapezoidal pieces and the broken
edges  forming  long  sides  with  blade  edges  at  either  end.  [chisel-
shaped arrowhead, transverse arrowhead]

petit-tranchet derivative arrowhead: a Late Neolithic ﬂint arrowhead of
Britain patterned on petit-tranchet arrowhead forms, including trian-
gular and trapezoidal pieces. [PTD arrowhead]

petraria: a type of heavy siege engine that hurled stones at castles with
the  effect  of  modern  shrapnel.  The  trebuchet  was  the  largest  of  the
petrariae,  or  siege  engines.  It  consisted  of  a  long  beam,  up  to  15 m
(50 feet) long, with massive weights of 8–9 tons at one end. It rested
on  a  crossbeam  and  the  long  arm  was  hauled  down  by  a  rope
attached to the end and wound on to the windlass. [petrariae (pl.)]
petriﬁed wood: agatized wood, sometimes used as a raw material for the
manufacture of ﬂaked stone artifacts. It was often banded or laminated
and of variable color.

petroglyph: any design, picture, or writing carved or chipped into a rock
surface. The technique involved in producing a petroglyph usually was
incising, carving, pecking, or pounding. [petrogram]

pewter: a tin-based alloy used as a material from which domestic utensils
were fashioned. The alloy is often 100 parts of tin to 17 of antimony;
or 89 of tin, 7 of antimony, and 2 of copper. Tin and zinc, and lead
and tin, are sometimes used to make pewter. The use of pewter dates
back at least 2000 years to Roman times. Ancient pewter contained
about 70% tin and 30% lead. Such pewter, also called black metal,
darkened greatly with age, and the lead leached out in contact with
acidic foods.

PF beaker: abbreviation of protruding foot beaker. [see protruding foot

beaker]

Phaistos disk:  a  unique  clay  disk  with  stamped  inscriptions  in  a  spiral
on  each  face  of  its  16 cm  (6-inch)  diameter,  found  in  1908  at
Phaistos, Crete. It is made of baked clay and on either side is an inscrip-
tion, which consists of signs impressed on the wet clay with a punch
or stamp. The Phaistos disk is therefore the world’s ﬁrst typewritten
document in the words of John Chadwick. There are a total of 242

PICARDY  PIN

239

signs  arranged  into  61  groups  demarcated  into  boxes  by  lines.  The
signs appear to be written from the outer edge and spiral inwards in
a clockwise direction. The disk come from a deposit dated c. 1700 bc,
which makes it contemporary with the Linear A script. At this time,
however, it appears to not be Linear A but may be an Anatolian script.
[Phaestos disk]

phalera: in ancient Greece and Rome, a bright metal disk worn on the
chest as an ornament by men, or used to adorn the harnesses of horses.
[phalerae (pl.)]

phallic:  relating  to  or  resembling  a  phallus  or  penis,  sometimes  erect,

used in the decoration of objects. [phallus (n.)]

Pharaonic period: the entire history of Egypt from the establishment of

the monarchy in 2925 bc to the invasion of Alexander in 332 bc.

phaskon: Greek vessel of a ﬂattened ovoid form, with a long spout, and

a handle at the top, like the askos.

phial:  a  small  cylindrical  glass  bottle,  typically  for  medical  samples  or

phiale: in Greek antiquity, a shallow dish used either for drinking or for

medicines. [vial]

pouring libations.

Phigalian Marbles: friezes kept in the British Museum, from the Temple
of Apollo Epicurius, at Bassae near ancient Phigalia in Arcadia. There
are  23  slabs  in  high  relief,  11  representing  the  battle  between  the
Centaurs and the Lapithae, and the rest the contest of the Greeks and
Amazons. It is attributed to the same period as the Parthenon.

philyra: strips of papyrus used for making a sheet of writing paper; 10–12
strips  of  papyrus  were  ﬁrst  glued  together  lengthwise  and  then  a
sufﬁcient  number  of  strips  were  fastened  crosswise  underneath  to 
double the thickness of the surface. [philura]

Phocaean  ware:  Roman  red-glossed  pottery  made  from  the  4th  to 
7th century ad on the west coast of Turkey. It was widely distributed
in the eastern Mediterranean area.

phylactery:  general  term  that  includes  any  kind  of  amulet  worn  about
the  person  as  a  protection  against  dangers.  The  name  phylactery  is
derived from the Greek phylakterion, meaning “amulet.”

phyllite: a soft, laminated, shale-like rock used for the manufacture of

decorative objects such as pendants and beads.

phyllosilicate: a layered silicate mineral; it is the major category of clay
minerals, composed of those with a regular ordering of layers of sil-
ica and alumina structural components.

Picardy  pin:  type  of  bronze  pin  of  northern  France  and  southern
England in the Ornament Horizon, Middle Bronze Age, with a taper-
ing  shaft,  swollen  neck  (sometimes  pierced),  an  elaborate  domed  or
mushroom-shaped head, and some incised decoration.

PICK

pick: a heavy iron tool with a wooden handle and a curved head that
is pointed on both ends; also, a long narrow core tool, sometimes slightly
curved in proﬁle, truncated at one end and pointed at the other.

pickax: a pick with a point at one end and a cutting blade at the other

end. [pickaxe]

Pictish symbol stones: Pictish symbol stones are a unique class of sculp-
tured monument of the Pictish people in the post-Roman period. The
Picts occupied Scotland north of the Forth and possessed a distinctive
culture,  seen  particularly  in  their  carved  symbol  stones.  The  stones 
are roughly divided into three chronological categories. Class I stones
(5th to 7th century ad) are rough-hewn, undressed blocks or pillars,
inscribed with pictorial symbols of spiral creatures, such as ﬁshes and
birds. They are also decorated with strange geometric shapes as well
as inanimate objects like mirrors and combs, grouped together in vari-
ous combinations. Class II stones (8th to 10th century) are regularly
dressed slabs with the same range of carvings but with the addition
of new Christian elements and humans in animated scenes. Class III
stones (from the 9th century) are, in most cases, free-standing crosses
decorated with a combination of a distinctive form of interlace as well
as some elements of the older motifs. Some bear Ogham inscriptions
from which it has recently been shown that three languages were in
use, two Celtic and one pre-Indo-European. From these memorial stones
we know something of the Pictish royal succession.

pictograph: any design, picture, or drawing painted on a surface (usually
rock/stone) and used to represent a thing, action, or event. Pictographs
are  believed  to  be  the  earliest  form  in  the  development  of  writing 
(pictography). It represents a form of nonverbal communication used
by nonliterate people. [petrograph, pictogram]

picture-stone:  a  term  used  to  describe  the  unique  series  of  engraved 
memorial stones (bildstenar) that were raised on the Baltic island of
Gotland (off Sweden) between the 5th and 11th centuries ad. The Kylver
Stone, found in a Gotland tomb, is a limestone slab that bears a 5th-
century runic inscription and provides the oldest extant record of the
Germanic runic series.

PIE: a unit containing as much statistical information as a single com-
plete vessel but based on the sum of completeness indices of sherds.
The PIE (pottery information equivalent) values yield unbiased estimates
of the proportion of each pottery type in a sampled population. [pot-
tery information equivalent]

piece esquillee: a type of ﬂaked stone artifact manufactured by the bipolar
percussion  technique.  It  is  generally  characterized  by  a  lenticular  or
wedge-shaped cross-section, opposed bifacial crushing, battering, and
hinge-fracturing, and frequently relatively long columnar “bladelike”
ﬂake scars. [splintered piece]

together, for casting intricately shaped metal objects.

piercing:  perforating  the  wall  of  a  ceramic  artifact  while  still  plastic 
by  pushing  a  sharpened  cylindrical  tool  (like  an  awl)  through  it  or
drilling a hole through a thin stone or ﬁred ceramic. [to pierce (v.)]
pig: an ingot of metal, especially lead or iron, from a smelting furnace.
pig ﬁbula pin: a pin made from the ﬁbula (bone) of a pig, with a long
narrow triangular outline and a perforation at the thicker wider top
end, from northern Europe in the later 1st millennium ad.

pigment:  an  organic  or  inorganic  coloring  material,  usually  a  mixture

of colorants, clay, water, and a binder.

pike: a type medieval weapon with a long narrow lance-like head and

a very long shaft.

pila muralia: a double-pointed wooden stake carried by Roman soldiers

for fortifying the ramparts of temporary camps.

pilgrim  bottle:  a  ceramic  barrel-shaped  or  cylindrical  container,  with 
two  suspension  lugs,  thought  to  be  carried  by  pilgrims  for  liquids.

pillar-molded  bowl:  a  type  of  Roman  glass  bowl  made  by  casting

molten glass, usually brightly colored.

pin: one of the simplest artifacts, consisting of a narrow metal or bone
shaft with a point at one end and usually some sort of decorative head
at the other. Its function was to secure garments (ancestral to the ﬁbula)
or, sometimes, the hair. Their decorative heads were highly variable
and nonfunctional, and therefore a culturally signiﬁcant feature.

pin beater: a thin rod of wood or bone (occasionally stone) with taper-
ing ends used to compact the weft threads on an upright loom by push-
ing down between each of the warp threads one at a time.

pincers: a tool for gripping with, often used to pinch objects together.
pinching: the creation of a ceramic item by pinching a ball of paste with-
out  using  a  mold,  wheel,  slabs,  or  coils.  It  is  a  primary  forming 
technique for producing cups, small bowls, and other small vessels by
squeezing  the  paste  between  the  thumb  and  ﬁngers.  [pinch  method,
pinch pottery; pinched (adj.)]

Pinsdorf ware: hard-ﬁred pots made in the villages in the Vorgebirge Hills,
west  of  Cologne  and  Bonn  in  Germany.  The  earliest  example  is  the
Wermelskirchen coin hoard pot, dated to c. ad 960. Pingsdorf ware
is characteristically decorated with red paint and commonly occurs as
pitchers  with  thumb-impressed  ring  bases;  smaller  pots,  including
money-boxes and toys, were also made. The products were exported
to all parts of the Rhineland, as well as to Britain and Scandinavia.

PINTADERA

Pinto Basin point

pintadera: a small object, usually of terra cotta, consisting of a decora-
tive stamp with a knob at the back for holding. The stamping surface
is ﬂat, concave, or convex. It has been suggested that they served to
apply pigments to the human skin in repeat patterns as an alternative
to tattooing. They are found in the Late Neolithic of central Europe
and Italy, and pintaderas of both stamp and roller types occur widely
in American cultures.

pintle: a pin or bolt, especially one on which some other object turns.
Pinto  point:  bifacially  worked,  chipped  stone  projectile  point  charac-
teristic  of  the  Pinto  Basin  phase  of  western  North  America  5000–
1900 bc. Triangular in outline, Pinto points are shouldered towards
the  bottom  of  the  long  side  to  produce  a  straight  stem;  they  have  a
hollow base.

pipe-stem  dating:  a  method  of  calculating  the  date  of  American
Colonial  assemblages  based  on  the  variation  in  hole  diameters  in 
clay pipe stems. J. C. Harrington ﬁrst drew attention to the fact that 
there was a general reduction in hole size from 1620 to 1800. Lewis
Binford then developed a regression equation, y = 1931.85 − 38.26x,
where y is the mean date for the group and x is the mean pipe-stem
diameter for the sample (A New Method of Calculating Dates from
Kaolin  Pipe  Stem  Samples,  L.  R.  Binford).  The  formula  works  well
for the period 1680–1760, but fails to produce satisfactory results for
post-1780 assemblages.

pipestone: any soft stone used in the manufacture of aboriginal smok-

ing pipes.

pipkin: a type of medieval ceramic vessel shaped like a saucepan, with

a single hollow handle for holding a wooden extension.

piquant-triedre:  a  bladelet  that  has  been  notched  and  then  had  a
microburin  twisted  off  at  the  notch;  the  microburin  scar  forms  as  a
thin extended point.

Pirri graver: an Australian tool type with extensive ﬂaking on one face
and an underside curvature as well as retouched cutting edge on the
narrow  end.  They  are  up  to  80 mm  (3.5  inches)  long  and  seem  to 
correspond to those of the Tula. [pirri graver]

Pirri point: an Australian stone tool type, with a symmetrical leaf-shaped
point, up to 7 cm (2.75 inches) long, and unifacially ﬂaked all over
its  dorsal  surface.  The  striking  platform  and  bulb  of  percussion  are
sometimes removed to produce a rounded, thinned butt. Pirri points
have  been  found  distributed  widely  in  inland  Australia  from  South
Australia  to  the  Northern  Territory  and  northwestern  Australia.  A 
component  of  the  Australian  Small  Tool  tradition,  the  Pirri  point 
dates from about 3000 bc. The aboriginal term pirri means “wood-
engraving tool.” [Pirri culture, pirri point]

piscina: a bowl for the ritual washing of hands.
pit ﬁring: a method of ﬁring ceramics using an open or exposed ﬂame

as opposed to a kiln.

pitcher:  a  large  jug  or  deep  vessel  with  an  open  mouth  and  usually  a

handle and spout, for collecting, storing, or serving liquids.

pitchfork:  a  long-handled  hand  tool  with  sharp,  widely  spaced  prongs

for lifting and pitching hay.

pitchstone: any of various volcanic glasses distinguished by their dull pitch-

like luster.

Pit-Comb ware: a coarse pottery with deep, round-based bowls decor-
ated  with  pits  and  comb  impressions  and  used  in  the  circumpolar 
cultures  of  the  forest  zone  of  northeast  Europe.  The  area  includes 
that around the southern Baltic and the glacial outwash of central and
eastern  Poland.  Its  makers  were  probably  hunters  and  ﬁshers,  mak-
ing little use of the techniques of food production, although adopting
such  Neolithic  traits  as  pot-making  and  ax-grinding.  There  are  few
sites and little data.

pithos: a large Greek earthenware storage jar with a narrow neck, used
for oil, wine, or grain. They were used on occasion for jar burial in
the Aegean area. [pithoi (pl.)]

pito:  Mexican  name  for  the  pipe  of  the  Aztecs,  which  resembled  a 

ﬂageolet. It was made of red clay, and had four ﬁngerholes.

Plainview point: bifacially worked, chipped stone projectile point with
parallel  sides  and  a  concave  base  found  in  central  areas  of  North
America c. 8000 bc. The complex was associated with this point and
with nondiagnostic stone and bone tools. [Plainview]

plaited:  basketry  made  with  both  a  horizontal  and  a  vertical  stitch  or
weft  –  like  a  braid.  The  weave  is  basically  the  same  in  both  direc-
tions. [plaited basketry]

plank cofﬁn: a box of wooden planks ﬁxed together for holding a corpse,
usually recognized archaeologically from the pattern of nails found in
the grave or by the patterns of grave ﬁll.

Plano point: name of projectile points developed out of the Clovis and
Folsom  points  of  the  Big  Game  Hunting  tradition,  after  8000 bc in

Plainview

244

PLANO  POINT

North America. Unﬂuted, large, lanceolate stone forms were made by
pressure-ﬂaking techniques. The two main types of Plano points are
Plainview,  of  7800–5100 bc,  and  Parallel,  which  are  longer,  more 
slender, and more ﬁnely made. [Plano projectile point]

planoconvex: pertaining to an artifact with one ﬂat and one convex side.

[plano-convex]

planoconvex brick: a sun-dried or kiln-ﬁred rectangular brick with a ﬂat
undersurface and a domed upper surface, used in the Early Dynastic
period  of  southern  Mesopotamia.  They  often  had  thumb-impressed
holes  on  the  domed  surface.  They  were  used  with  mud  mortar  in 
vertical courses inclined in alternating directions to create a herring-
bone pattern.

plaster:  a  mixture  of  lime  or  gypsum  with  sand  and  water;  it  hardens

into a smooth solid and is used to cover walls and ceilings.

plastered  skull:  skulls  found  at  Jericho,  Israel,  which  were  covered  in
plaster and painted as well as decorated with cowry shells in the orbits.
They were found in Pre-Pottery Neolithic B contexts at several sites
in Syro-Palestine.

plastic limits: range in the amount of water that may be added to a dry

clay in order to develop a satisfactorily plastic mass.

plasticity: property of a material that enables it to be shaped when wet

and to hold this shape when the shaping force is removed.

plate: a shallow dish in which food is served or from which it is eaten;
household articles, such as hollow ware, covered with a precious metal,
such as silver or gold. [platter]

plate  armor:  protective  armor  in  the  form  of  sheet  iron  ﬁttings  (metal
plates) tailored to the shape of the body and strapped in position, com-
mon in 15th to 16th-century ad Europe. The knights of the European
Middle Ages wore this armor, composed of large steel or iron plates
that  were  linked  by  loosely  closed  rivets  and  by  internal  leathers  to
allow the wearer maximum freedom of movement. [plate armour]

platform:  the  place  on  a  core  or  ﬂake  where  it  was  struck  by  a  ham-

mer. [striking platform]

platform angle: angle between the plane of the platform and the exter-

ior (dorsal) surface of a ﬂake or core.

plating:  a  process  of  coating  a  metal  or  other  material  such  as  plastic
or  china  with  a  hard,  nonporous  metallic  surface  to  improve  dur-
ability and beauty. Gold, silver, stainless steel, palladium, copper, and
nickel are formed by dipping an object into a solution containing the
desired  surface  material,  which  is  deposited  by  chemical  or  electro-
chemical action. While much plating is done for decorative purposes,
still more is done to increase the durability and corrosion-resistance
of softer materials.

PLIOCENE

platter: large shallow dish or plate.
Pleistocene: a geochronological division of geological time, an epoch of
the Quaternary period following the Pliocene. During the Pleistocene,
large areas of the northern hemisphere were covered with ice and there
were successive glacial advances and retreats. The Lower Pleistocene
began c. 1.8 million years ago, the Middle Pleistocene c. 730,000 years
ago, and the Upper Pleistocene c. 127,000 years ago; it ended about
10,000  years  ago.  Most  present-day  mammals  appeared  during  the
Pleistocene. The onset of the Pleistocene was marked by an increas-
ingly  cold  climate,  by  the  appearance  of  Calabrian  Mollusca and
Villafranchian  fauna  with  elephant,  ox,  and  horse  species,  and  by
changes in foraminifera. The oldest form of man had evolved by the
early Pleistocene (Australopithecus), and in archaeological terms the
cultures classed as Paleolithic all fall within this period. By the mid-
Pleistocene, Homo sapiens had evolved in Africa and Europe. Homo
sapiens spread to Asia and the Americas before the end of the epoch.
There  were  mass  extinctions  of  large  and  small  fauna  during  the
Pleistocene.  In  North  America  more  than  30  genera  of  large  mam-
mals became extinct within a span of roughly 2000 years during the
late  Pleistocene.  Of  the  many  causes  that  have  been  proposed  by 
scientists for these faunal extinctions, the two most likely are chang-
ing  environment  with  changing  climate,  and  the  disruption  of  the 
ecological pattern by early humans. The Pleistocene was succeeded by
the Holocene or present epoch.

Pleistocene  series:  a  division  of  the  Quaternary  system  deﬁned  by  its
deposits.  It  is  a  worldwide  division  of  rocks  deposited  during  the
Pleistocene  epoch  (1,600,000–10,000  years  ago).  It  overlies  rocks
from the Pliocene epoch (5.3–1.6 million years ago) and is itself over-
lain  by  rocks  of  the  Holocene  series;  together  these  two  latter  divi-
sions  make  up  the  Quaternary  system.  These  deposits  contain
evidence of humans and their development throughout glacial and inter-
glacial  conditions.  By  international  agreement,  the  global  stratotype
section/point for the base of the Pleistocene series is in the Vrica sec-
tion in Calabria, Italy. The Pleistocene’s boundary with the Pliocene
occurs just above the position of the magnetic reversal that marks the
Olduvai  normal  polarity  subzone,  thus  allowing  the  worldwide  cor-
relation of Pleistocene rocks with reference to the magneto-stratigraphic
time scale.

Pliocene:  the  latest  geological  epoch  of  the  Tertiary  period  dating
between  c.  5  million  years  ago  (mya)  and  the  beginning  of  the
Pleistocene  (c.  1.8 mya).  During  the  Pliocene,  mammals  such  as  the
elephant,  horse,  ox,  and  deer  appeared,  in  addition  to  ancestors  of
man. It followed the Miocene. There was a separation of the Homo

246

PLIOCENE

genus and the Australopithecus genus, with the ﬁrst worked tools and
the ﬁrst camps appearing. It is often divided into the Early Pliocene
epoch (5.3–3.4 mya) and the Late Pliocene epoch (3.4–1.8 mya). The
Pliocene is also subdivided into two ages and their corresponding rock
stages – the Zanclean and the Piacenzian.

Plio-Pleistocene: the later part of the Pliocene and the early part of the
Pleistocene, c. 5 to 1 million years ago. The early Plio-Pleistocene Homo
habilis appears  to  be  more  closely  related  to  Homo  sapiens than  is
Homo erectus.

plow:  a  tool  designed  to  be  drawn  through  the  ground  to  break  it  up
for cultivation, often powered by a yoke (or more) of oxen, other ani-
mals, or men. The earliest type of plow, developed from the hoe and
digging stick, is the ard or scratch plow, which stirs the soil without
turning it. Cross-plowing, the result of a second plowing at right angles
to  the  ﬁrst,  is  usually  necessary.  This  type  was  of  Near  Eastern 
origin  c.  4th  millennium  bc.  The  later  plow,  heavier  and  wheeled, 
did  not  appear  until  the  early  centuries  ad.  It  is  more  suited  to  the
heavier  soils  of  Europe.  Prehistoric  America,  lacking  suitable  draft 
animals, did not have a plow. The 18th-century addition of the mold-
board,  which  turned  the  furrow  slice  cut  by  the  plowshare,  was  an
important advance. The plow is considered the most important agri-
cultural implement of history, used to turn and break up soil, to bury
crop residues, and to help control weeds. [plough]

plow beam: a wooden or metal bar that connects the blades, shares, and
their mountings to the yoke of a plow, then attached to the harnesses
ﬁtted to the draught animals that provide the power. [plough beam]
plowshare: part of a plow that goes into the ground to disturb or turn

the soil. [ploughshare]

Plumbate ware: a ﬁne pottery made on the Paciﬁc coast of Mesoamerica,
near the Mexico–Guatemala border, during early Post-Classic and pre-
Columbian  times.  It  was  traded  over  a  wide  area,  from  Nayarit  in
northwest Mexico to Costa Rica in the south, and was present in all
but the lowest levels in the Toltec center at Tula. The glazed appear-
ance of the surface of Plumbate ware is due to the unusual composi-
tion of the clay from which it is made and to carefully controlled ﬁring
conditions. There was a high percentage of iron compounds and, upon
ﬁring, the ceramic surface acquired a hard, lustrous, vitriﬁed surface
often with a metallic shine. Its original point of manufacture was on
the Paciﬁc coast of Mesoamerica in the vicinity of Izapa.

plummet: a stone artifact resembling a carpenter’s plumb bob, usually
made of basalt, slate, or hematite. Marked by a single groove around
it toward one end or the middle, it was possibly a sinker for ﬁshing
or of ceremonial or ritual use.

Plummet

POLISHED  STONE  ADZE

247

plunging  termination:  a  distinct  curvature  of  the  distal  end  of  a  lithic

ﬂake towards the center of the core. [overshot; plunging (adj.)]
ply: the strand(s) of material used in the construction of cordage.
poculum:  a  Roman  cup  or  glass  for  drinking,  distinct  from  the  crater

for mixing, and the cyathus for drawing wine from a bowl.

point: a category of stone artifacts consisting of pointed tools ﬂaked on
one or both sides; a weapon or tool having such a part and used for
stabbing or piercing, e.g., an arrowhead or spearhead. [projectile point]
point of percussion: point at which a core is struck with a hammerstone
in order to remove a ﬂake. The point of percussion is a visible excres-
cence on the core, a small scar on the struck ﬂake. The bulb of per-
cussion surrounds it.

point provenience: location (provenience) of a speciﬁc object at an exact

point on a site. [piece plotting]

pointillé: a type of decoration by marking with dots.
poison point: an arrowhead used not only to pierce the hide of an ani-
mal, but also to poison it; most were notchless and triangular so that
the shaft of the arrow could detach easily and remain in the wound
after being soaked in snake venom or decayed meat, etc.

poker: a bar or rod, usually of metal, used to push another object into

place, e.g., to push coals within a ﬁre.

pole ax:  a  long  shaft  topped  by  an  axhead.  It  differs  from  a  battle  ax

by the length of the shaft. [pole axe]

polish:  a  shiny  surface  that  often  occurs  macroscopically  or  micro-
scopically near the used edges of lithic ﬂakes or blades as a result of
use on particular materials. [polishing (n.)]

polished axhead: an axhead of ﬂint or other stone, commonly used in

the Neolithic period.

polished stone adze: a chopping or cutting tool, beveled on one side and
characteristic of the Neolithic in Southeast Asia. It appeared as early
as 6000 bc in some places and continued in use into the 1st millen-
nium ad in places with little metal. They were generally ﬂaked to shape
from a large core, and then ground and polished. Traded forms were

248

POLISHED  STONE  ADZE

roughed-out  blanks  that  would  be  polished  later.  The  form  was  a 
simple quadrangle. By the Late Neolithic a decrease in the proportion
of stone axes to adzes suggests the increasing dominance of perman-
ent agriculture.

polished tool: any artifact made by the pecking or grinding of hard stones.
During the Neolithic period was the ﬁrst widespread use of polished
rock tools, notably axes, with the adoption of a new technique of stone-
working. The revolutionary method used to create polished tools was
essentially a ﬁnishing process that slicked a chipped tool by rubbing
it  on  or  with  an  abrasive  rock  to  remove  the  scars  of  the  chipping
process that had produced the rough tool. Not only was the edge keener,
but  the  smooth  sides  of  the  edge  also  promoted  deeper  penetration,
with the added advantage of easier tool extraction from a deep wedged
cut. [ground stone tool]

polisher: polished bone used to burnish objects, e.g., pottery.
polissoir: 1. A polishing or grinding implement, especially for stone axes.
2. A tool consisting of a ﬂat wooden block with a long iron handle,
used for ﬂattening out split cylinders of blown glass.

polychrome pottery: pottery that is decorated in more than two colors,

but the term is also applied to pottery with more than one color.

polyhedron: a six-sided pebble or piece of stone that has been totally or
partly reshaped by chipping of the surface in a number of directions; it
resembles a ball. They were ﬁrst created in pre-Acheulian, Acheulian, and
Middle Paleolithic times and were used as percussion tools, throwing
weapons, and nuclei for ﬂakes. [polyhedral core]

polypod  bowl:  a  bowl  that  stands  on  two,  three,  or  four  small  legs  –
found especially in Middle American archaeology. The form was also
popular among the southwestern groups of the Beaker folk and in related
central European wares.

Pompeian red ware: a type of colored Roman pottery from France and
exported to the Roman world c. late 1st century bc and 1st century ad.
Pontic  ware:  black-ﬁgured  pottery  made  in  Etruria  during  the  Archaic
period, possibly inﬂuenced by techniques from Attica, Corinth, and Ionia.
pontil scar:  the  characteristic  mark  left  on  the  base  of  glass  vessels  by

breaking off the glass-blower’s rod.

poppy  head  beaker:  a  beaker  in  the  shape  of  the  head  of  a  poppy,  in
gray or back, with a polished surface, everted rim, and body decorated
with barbotine or rouletting.

porcelain: vitriﬁed pottery with a white, ﬁne-grained body that is usu-
ally translucent, as distinguished from earthenware, which is porous,
opaque, and coarser. Porcelain is a ﬁne form of pottery that is ﬁred
to  a  very  high  temperature  in  order  to  vitrify  the  clay.  The  name  is
derived from the Portuguese porcellana (“little pigs,” the name given

POT  LID

249

to cowrie shells by early traders). Porcelain was developed by the Chinese
from a long tradition of making stoneware in white clay. In the T’ang
dynasty  (ad 618–906])  came  proto-porcelains,  followed  by  true
porcelain in the Sung dynasty (ad 960–1279). The three main types
of porcelain are: true, or hard-paste, porcelain; artiﬁcial, or soft-paste,
porcelain; and bone china.

porphyry:  a  rock  containing  relatively  large,  conspicuous  crystals, 
especially feldspar, in a ﬁne-grained igneous matrix, used for statues
and sculptures.

porringer: a small bowl, often with a handle, used for soup or similar dishes.
portable art: artifacts or pieces of art that can easily be moved.
positive painting: direct application of a design by use of pigments, as

in painting pottery.

Post-Classic period: ﬁnal pre-Columbian period in New World cultural
history,  following  the  collapse  of  the  Classic  period  civilizations,
starting in ad 750/900 until 1520. The period is characterized by metal-
working,  complex  urban  societies,  advanced  commerce,  militarism, 
imperialism, and secularism. It is traditionally dated from the fall of
the Classic Maya in 900, but the collapse did not occur simultaneously
throughout Mesoamerica. [Postclassic period]

post-Deverel-Rimbury ware: pottery of southern England from about the
ﬁrst  half  of  the  1st  millennium  bc,  replacing  the  previous  Deverel-
Rimbury traditions. The wares were ﬁneware, thin-walled plain jars,
bowls, and cups, along with coarseware including large storage ves-
sels.  Starting  c.  8th  century  bc,  there  is  more  decoration,  especially
incised lines, ﬁngertip impressions, and cordons.

postglacial period: a period occurring after a glacial episode, especially
one from the end of the Pleistocene Ice Age c. 8300 bc to the present.
The substages in northern Europe are: Pre-Boreal (c. 8300–7700 bc),
Boreal (7700–5550 bc), Atlantic (5550–3800 bc), Sub-Boreal (3800–
1200 bc), and Sub-Atlantic (1200 bc to present).

Postpalatial:  in  Minoan  Crete,  the  period  after  the  destruction  of  the
palaces,  a  part  of  the  chronological  system  for  the  area  devised  by
Platon. It is the same as Late Minoan IIIA2–IIIC, c. 1375–1100 bc,
in traditional chronology.

pot: a container, usually round and deep.
pot boiler: name given to stones, often ﬂint, that have been heated in a
ﬁre and have a white or grayish cracked appearance. They are thought
to have been used to heat water for cooking purposes.

pot lid: a small portion (ﬂake) of stone that may pop off a core during
heat treatment due to rapid heating or excessive temperature, creat-
ing many small ﬂake scars on the surface. Pot lid marks are conical
depressions in ﬂint that prove the item was once in a ﬁre; heat caused

250

POT  LID

the moisture in tiny hollows to expand and blow out a section of ﬂint.
[pot lid mark, pot-lid mark]

potash-lead glass: glass based on potash as a ﬂux with high concentra-
tions of lead. It is heavy, lustrous, and more refractive than other forms
of glass.

potash-lime glass: glass made using potash derived from burning wood.
pothunting: illegal artifact collecting.
potlid  fracture:  a  crater-like  pit  that  sometimes  occurs  on  the  surface 
of  lithic  raw  material  that  has  been  heated  or  frozen  and  thawed. 
[pot-lid fracture]

potsherd: any pottery fragment – piece of broken pot or other earthen-
ware item – that has archaeological signiﬁcance. Often abbreviated to
sherd,  potsherds  are  an  invaluable  part  of  the  archaeological  record
because  they  are  well  preserved.  The  analysis  of  ceramic  changes
recorded in potsherds has become one of the primary techniques used
by  archaeologists  in  assigning  components  and  phases  to  times  and
cultures. [shard, sherd]

potter’s comb: an implement with a serrated edge capable of producing
an impressed decoration on pottery. A marbled effect was sometimes
achieved  (as  in  Chinese  pottery  of  the  T’ang  dynasty)  by  mingling,
with a comb, slips of contrasting colors after they had been applied
to the vessel. Potter’s combs were made of stone, bone, shell, or wood.
potter’s  stamp:  a  small  block  used  by  a  potter  to  mark  the  base  of  a
vessel  while  it  was  still  soft,  to  personalize  it,  especially  on  Samian,
Arretine, and Gallo-Belgic wares.

potter’s  wheel:  a  wheel  rotating  horizontally  which  assists  a  potter  in
shaping clay into vessels. The development of the slow, or hand-turned,
wheel as an adjunct to pottery manufacture led to the kick wheel, rotated
by foot, which became the potter’s principal tool. The potter throws
the  clay  onto  a  rapidly  rotating  disk  and  shapes  his  pot  by  manip-
ulating  it  with  both  hands.  By  the  Uruk  phase  in  Mesopotamia, 
c. 3400 bc, the fast wheel was already in use. It spread slowly, reach-
ing Europe with the Minoans around 2400 bc, and Britain with the
Belgae  in  the  1st  century  bc.  Its  presence  can  be  taken  to  imply  an
organized pottery industry, often also using an advanced type of kiln.
pottery:  one  of  the  oldest  of  the  decorative  arts,  consisting  of  objects
made of clay and hardened with heat. The objects are commonly use-
ful. Earthenware is the oldest and simplest form of pottery; stoneware
is a pottery compound that is ﬁred at a sufﬁciently high temperature
to cause it to vitrify and become extremely hard; and porcelain, ﬁner
than stoneware and generally translucent, is made by adding feldspar
to kaolin and then ﬁring at a high temperature. The raw material of
pottery  is  common,  shaping  and  baking  it  are  simple,  and  it  can  be

PRE-BOREAL

Globular urn

given an inﬁnite variety of forms and decorations. Pottery sherds, almost
indestructible, are one of the commonest ﬁnds and are very important
to archaeologists. Pottery is often one of the clearest indicators of cul-
tural differences, relationships, and developments, and its techniques
of manufacture can be comparatively easily recovered by ceramic ana-
lysis.  It  can  be  shown  whether  it  was  modeled,  coil-built,  or  wheel-
made.  The  nature  of  its  fabric,  ware,  or  body  can  be  identiﬁed,  as 
can  any  surface  treatment  such  as  slip,  paint,  or  burnish.  The  wide
range  of  methods  of  decoration  can  also  be  studied.  As  the  date  of
manufacture  can  usually  be  ﬁxed,  pieces  of  pottery  give  clues  to 
archaeologists as to the date of other ﬁnds at the site. Petrological ana-
lysis of inclusions has been used to trace the source of pot clays and
thus reconstruct ancient trade in pottery. Archaeologists usually call
ﬁred pot clay the “fabric” of a piece of pottery. Texture, mineralogy,
and color of fabric may be used to describe and classify pottery.

pounder: a tool used to pound, crush, or beat an object.
Poverty Point projectile point: a projectile point, especially one with a
narrow stem–body juncture. Poverty Point site is located just west of
the Mississippi River in northeastern Louisiana. The site is signiﬁcant
because  its  earthworks  are  the  oldest,  large  aboriginal  constructions
known  in  mainland  North  America.  They  were  built  between  1730
and 1350 bc by Terminal Archaic hunter-gatherers.
prayer bead: a bead or group of beads used in prayer.
preaching cross: a class of monumental sculpture unique to the British
Isles, developed from the 7th century ad onwards. The tall, tapering
cross shaft rested on a plinth or base, and carried a three-armed cross
head.  Both  the  cross  and  the  shaft  were  usually  ornamented  with
Christian ﬁgures and other decorative motifs. They may be Celtic inter-
pretations of Mediterranean crosses and Iron Age stelae. [standing cross]
Pre-Boreal:  a  division  of  Holocene  chronology  which  began  about
10,000  years  ago  and  ended  about  9500  years  ago.  The  Pre-Boreal
climatic interval preceded the Boreal climatic interval and was a time
of increasing climatic moderation. Birch–pine forests and tundra were
dominant. It is a subdivision of the Flandrian interglacial and repres-
ents the start of the Flandrian.

252

PRECERAMIC

preceramic: before ceramics; referring to a period antedating the use of

ceramics or pottery.

Preceramic Period: the earliest of a seven-period chronological construction
used in Peruvian archaeology, c. 9000–1800 bc, starting with the ﬁrst
human occupation and ending with the introduction of ceramic arti-
facts. The Preceramic Period is usually subdivided into six periods and
is characterized by a variety of subsistence patterns and by a lack of
ceramics.  The  ﬁrst  two  periods  (up  to  8000 bc)  represent  a  subsist-
ence  based  on  hunting.  The  third  period,  c.  8000–6000 bc,  is  seen 
as  transitional  from  hunting  to  hunting  and  gathering.  Period  IV, 
c. 6000–4000 bc had cyclical, seasonal migration. In Preceramic V,
c. 4000–2500 bc, the lomas dried up and people tended to be sedent-
ary and agriculture supplied an increasing part of the diet. Large habi-
tation sites, ceremonial centers, and agriculture appear increasingly in
Preceramic VI, c. 2500–1800 bc. There are lithic complexes in the Early
Preceramic, followed by an Archaic period with foraging populations
and  the  beginning  of  domestic  and  ceremonial  architecture.  The
Preceramic was followed by the Initial Period.

Pre-Classic period: a period in Mesoamerican archaeology during which
agriculture formed the basis of settled village life, c. 2000 bc to ad 250.
The earliest writing – glyphs – in Mesoamerica began in this period.
The Olmec was the ﬁrst culture to appear in the Pre-Classic period.
A similar level was attained in Peru at about the same time (the Chavín
culture). In many other areas life remained on a Formative level until
the  Spanish  conquest.  The  ﬁnal  phase  of  the  Pre-Classic  cultures  of
the central highlands forms a transition from the village to the city,
from rural to urban life. [Preclassic period]

pre-Columbian: a term used to describe the period in the Americas before
European contact. Pre-Columbian civilization refers to the aboriginal
American  Indian  cultures  that  evolved  in  Mesoamerica  and  the
Andean  region  prior  to  Spanish  exploration  and  conquest  in  the 
16th century ad.

Predynastic period: the period before recorded history in Egypt and before
it  became  a  uniﬁed  state  in  c.  3100 bc.  The  term  “predynastic” 
denotes  the  period  of  emerging  cultures  that  preceded  the  establish-
ment of the 1st dynasty in Egypt. In the late 5th millennium bc there
began to emerge patterns of civilization that displayed characteristics
deserving to be called Egyptian. The accepted sequence of predynas-
tic  cultures  is  based  on  the  excavations  of  Sir  Flinders  Petrie  at
Naqadah, al-’Amirah (el-’Amra), and al-Jazirah (el-Gezira). Another,
somewhat  earlier,  stage  of  predynastic  culture  has  been  identiﬁed 
at  al-Badari  in  Upper  Egypt.  Until  recently,  most  of  our  knowledge
of  predynastic  Egypt  was  derived  from  the  excavation  of  graves.
Predynastic  communities  appeared  in  the  section  of  the  Nile  Valley

PRESERVATION

253

immediately  south  of  Asyut.  Large  settlements  were  established, 
notably that at Hierakonpolis. Some time after 5000 bc, the raising
of crops was introduced, probably on a horticultural scale, in small, 
local cultures that seem to have penetrated southward through Egypt
into  the  oases  and  the  Sudan.  The  food-producing  economy  was
based on the cultivation of emmer wheat and barley and on the herd-
ing of cattle and small stock, together with some ﬁshing, hunting, and
use of wild plant foods. Highly specialized craftsmen emerged to build
vessels, make copper objects, weave linen, and make basketry and pot-
tery. A series of small states arose until around 3100 bc the uniﬁed
kingdom of Ancient Egypt came into being. [pre-Dynastic period]

preform: a bifacially ﬂaked piece of stone that exhibits both percussion
and pressure ﬂaking, and which usually is triangular in shape, indic-
ating that it was being fashioned into a projectile point or knife.

prehistoric: time period before the appearance of written records.
prehistory: any period for which there is no documentary evidence, and
the study of cultures before written history or of more recent cultures
lacking  formal  historical  records.  In  the  strict  sense,  “history”  is  an
account of the past recovered from written records, but such an account
can  be  prepared  from  other  sources,  notably  archaeology.  The  term
“prehistory” was coined by Daniel Wilson in 1851 to cover the story
of man’s development before the appearance of writing. It is succeeded
by protohistory, the period for which we have some records but must
still rely largely on archaeological evidence to give us a coherent account.
Prehistory differs from history in dealing with the activities of a soci-
ety  or  culture,  not  of  the  individual;  it  is  restricted  to  the  material 
evidence that has survived.

Prepalatial:  in  Minoan  Crete,  the  period  before  the  construction  of 
the  palaces,  a  part  of  the  chronological  system  for  the  area  devised
by Platon. It is the same as Early Minoan I–III, c. 3000–2000 bc, in
traditional chronology.

prepared core: a nodule of chert, ﬂint, or obsidian that has been shaped

to easily produce blades.

prepared-core technique: a method of stone-tool production whereby cores
themselves  are  shaped  in  order  to  produce  ﬂakes  of  a  desired  form,
instead  of  the  ﬂakes  being  shaped  after  their  removal  from  the 
core.

pre-projectile  point  complex:  a  term  applied  to  a  complex  consisting 
of  the  earliest  archaeological  evidence  of  humans  on  the  North
American continent. It is characterized by the lack of stone projectile
points, which can be dated.

preservation: the protection of artifacts and archaeological sites through
activities that minimize deterioration and damage and that prevent loss
of context and content.

Preform

PRESS  MOLD

press  mold:  a  mold  used  to  shape  the  exterior  of  a  glass  item  while  a

plunger shapes the interior of the item.

pressure ﬂake: tiny, extremely thin ﬂakes pinched or pushed off a tool
to ﬁnish shaping it or to resharpen or reshape it. [retouching ﬂake]
pressure ﬂaking: a method for the secondary working of ﬂint tools involv-
ing the use of a hard object against a stone core or mass to remove
ﬂakes. The roughed-out form of the tool is sharpened and ﬁnished by
exerting  pressure  with  a  bone,  antler,  stone,  or  stick  on  the  edge  in
order  to  remove  small  thin  chips.  By  using  a  short,  pointed  instru-
ment to pry, not strike, the tiny ﬂakes leave only the smallest scars.
As  the  least  violent  and  most  advanced  of  the  methods  of  working
stone,  it  gave  the  craftsman  the  ultimate  in  control  for  the  removal
of materials in the shaping of an implement. Fine-edged weapons, such
as daggers, arrowheads, and spearheads, can be produced using this
technique.  This  technique  was  ﬁrst  widely  used  in  the  Solutrean,  c.
18,000 bc, and is associated with some New World points. [pressure

prestige goods: exchange goods, often limited in range, to which a soci-
ety ascribes high status or value. Examples are amber, copper, glass
beads, and marine shells. High-prestige goods served to enhance the
political value of the trade to local elites who directed and controlled
it. [prestige goods chain]

previous scar: a blade or ﬂake scar seen on the face of a blade or ﬂake
resulting from the initial removal of a blade or a ﬂake from a core or
nodule.

primary context: an undisturbed association, matrix, and provenience;
the  condition  when  they  have  not  been  disturbed  since  the  original
deposition of the archaeological data.

primary ﬂake: an unretouched ﬂake of stone from which smaller ﬂakes
are removed during knapping; a ﬂake with its dorsal aspect completely
covered by cortex. [cortical ﬂake, decortication ﬂake]

PROTOHISTORIC

primary ﬂaking: initial ﬂaking, usually broad, shallow, random percus-
sion,  that  is  used  to  roughly  shape  a  preform  into  a  desired  outline
for a tool or projectile.

primary forming: in ceramics manufacture, the technique used to build
up the overall shape of the vessel. Secondary forming techniques are
used to reﬁne this shape and thin the walls.

primary product: the material gained by killing an animal, e.g., skin.
primary refuse: unwanted objects or materials found in the context where

they were used and discarded.

prismatic blade: a ﬂake struck from a polyhedral core, at least twice as
long as it is wide, with steep, parallel sides and trapezoidal (prismatic)
in cross-section. [prismatic ﬂake]

prismatic core: a block of ﬂint prepared for the removal of long narrow
blades by creating a striking platform at either end so that blades could
be removed in alternate directions.

projectile  point:  general  term  for  the  stone,  bone,  or
wooden tip of a projectile – the point that is attached
to a weapon such as an arrow, dart, lance, or spear.
Among such points are arrowheads, which are usually
of  small  size,  and  darts  and  spearpoints,  which  may
be quite large. These tools are valuable in the recon-
struction of culture history. [point]

promontory  peg:  a  type  of  carved  wooden  artifact,
probably used as the trigger for a snare, and ﬁrst re-
cognized at the Promontory Caves, northwest of Salt
Lake City, Utah.

prondnik: a type of stone artifact that is an asymmetri-

cal scraping tool ﬂaked on both sides and found on some late Middle
Neolithic sites of central Europe.

prong: point or tine of a fork or forklike tool.
proto-: indicating an early developmental stage of the main root word,
e.g., prototype, proto-Villanovan, protohistoric, etc. It means “begin-
ning” or “giving rise to.”

Proto-Classic period: in Mesoamerica, the period at the end of the Pre-
Classic and immediately before the Classic period, c. 50 bc to ad 250.
It  refers  to  the  cultures  of  the  Maya  area  which  were  transitioning
between the Pre-Classic and Classic.

protogeometric, Protogeometric: a type of Greek painted pottery and the
period of its making, c. 1050–900 bc, which succeeded the Mycenaean.
The style emerged at Athens and then other regions. Decoration was
severely geometric and included concentric circles and the use of zigzags
and triangles. [Proto-Geometric]

protohistoric: transition period between the prehistoric and historic eras.

PROTOHISTORY

protohistory: the period in any area following prehistory and preceding
the appearance of coherent history derived from written records. It is
a  transitional  time  period  between  prehistory  and  recorded  history,
for  which  both  archaeological  and  historical  data  are  employed.
There are several more detailed deﬁnitions, such as: (1) a time when
nonliterate  aboriginal  peoples  had  access  to  European  goods  but 
had not had face-to-face contact; (2) periods during which historical
documentation is fragmentary or not directly from the society being
studied; and (3) the period of ad 1250–1519 in Mesoamerica, which
followed  the  Post-Classic  period  and  ends  just  before  the  Spanish 
conquest (there are historical documents for this period).

proto-majolica:  a  type  of  tin-glazed  ware  made  in  Sicily  and  southern
Italy from shortly before 1200 until the 15th century. The appearance
of  these  wares  coincided  with  the  importation  of  tin-glazed  pottery
from  North  Africa,  particularly  Maghreb.  The  jugs  and  bowls  were
usually painted with various animals or coats-of-arms in a variety of
colors before glaze was applied. The best-known proto-majolicas are
from  northern  Apulia;  they  were  traded  extensively  to  local  villages
and across the Adriatic to Yugoslavia. [proto-maiolica]

protome: decorative motif in the form of a human or animal head.
Proto-Neolithic: a transitional period between the hunting and gather-
ing  cultures  of  the  Epipaleolithic  and  the  farming  cultures  of  the
Aceramic Neolithic (c. 9300–8500 bc). The term is used variously but
here it includes the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A of the Levant and the early
stages of the adoption of characteristic Neolithic traits such as animal
and plant domestication and the manufacture of pottery.

Protopalatial: in Minoan Crete, the period of the Old or First palaces,
a part of the chronological system for the area devised by Platon. It
is the same as Middle Minoan I–II, c. 2000–1700 bc, in traditional
chronology.

Protosesklo: a term used for the Greek Early Neolithic period or the Early

Neolithic in Thessaly.

Proto-Three Kingdoms: the protohistoric period of the Korean peninsula,
c. ad 1–300, which preceded the Three Kingdoms period of Koguryo,
Silla, and the Paekche. Archaeological ﬁnds of the period are mainly
from Lelang and Koguryo in the north and Samhan in the south. Bronze
and  iron  were  used  and  iron  was  made  at  shell  midden  sites  on  the
southern  coast.  In  actuality,  the  Three  Kingdoms  period  was  from 
c. 57 bc to ad 668.

prototype: a prototype is the ﬁrst in a series of artifacts, the earliest form
of some type which later develops (e.g., the ﬁrst of a new type of pot-
tery). A prototype is also a model after which objects are copied: the
prototype for a clay wine jar could be a metal wine jug of similar shape.

protruding foot beaker, Protruding Foot Beaker: typical vessel of the Late
Neolithic in the Netherlands with radiocarbon dates from c. 3200 to
2400 bc.  The  basic  form  had  a  splayed  neck,  S-shaped  proﬁle,  and
ﬂat everted base. It had cord ornament, dentate spatula impressions,
or herringbone incisions. The vessel also deﬁnes the culture, which had
burial in either a single ﬂat grave or a pit under a barrow, and used
the  battle  ax.  The  culture  represents  the  Dutch  branch  of  the  wide-
spread Corded ware–Battle-ax complex, or Single Grave cultures. In
the Netherlands, there is some hybridization between the Protruding
Foot Beaker culture and the Bell Beaker culture. [PF beaker]

provenience: source, origin, or location of an artifact or feature and the
recording of the same. It is the position of an archaeological ﬁnd in
time  and  space,  recorded  three-dimensionally.  The  horizontal  refer-
ence  system  is  usually  some  form  of  grid  tied  to  a  reference  datum;
the  vertical  dimension  is  reference  to  a  vertical  datum.  That  is,  it  is
the three-dimensional position of an archaeological ﬁnd in time and
space and recorded from a known datum point at an archaeological
site. [provenance]

proximal: the extremity of a stone artifact that has or once had the bulb

of percussion. [proximal end]

proximal corner: parts of a blade nearest the stem that deﬁne the outer-
most ends of the blade edge if the stem were ignored or removed. [barb]
proximal  portion:  that  part  of  a  blade  nearest  the  stem  of  the  hafting

area, or the area of a tool nearest the basal edge.

proximal shoulder angle: a term describing the shape of the base on a
projectile point, based on the angle formed by the hafting notch and
the axis of the shaft.

prunts:  globules  of  glass  that  may  or  may  not  be  molded  or  cut  into

shapes but that are attached to an otherwise complete glass object.

psalia:  ancient  accessories  of  horse  bits  or  cheek  pieces,  comprising  a
pair of vertical rods which were attached perpendicularly to the ends
of bits and which served for attaching the reins and as a stop piece.
Psalia  of  bone,  wood,  bronze,  and  iron  were  used  everywhere  there
was horse riding. Their shapes are varied and useful for chronologi-
cal and cultural attributions.

psephoperibombetrios: in Greek antiquity, a type of drinking cup with
a hollow rim into which pellets were inserted. When it was shaken, it
may have attracted attention for more wine or was used to accompany
the symposium’s music. There are 4th century bc kantharoi examples.
pseudoartifact:  any  object  that  appears  to  be  a  manmade  tool,  but 

actually has been molded by natural forces.

Ptolemaic Egypt: term describing Egypt during the Hellenistic era, when
it was ruled by the dynasty of the Macedonian general Ptolemy I Soter

258

PTOLEMAIC  EGYPT

(reigned 305/304–283/282 bc) and his descendants. The Ptolemaic period
was a large-scale experiment in bureaucratic centralism and mercant-
ilism.  Egypt  was  ruled  by  Ptolemy’s  descendants  until  the  death  of
Cleopatra VII on August 12, 30 bc.

pueblo,  Pueblo:  in  its  capitalized  form,  a  term  for  a  stage  in  various
chronologies of the American southwest, typically spanning the time
period from ad 700 to the 1700s and to a speciﬁc Native American
group,  culture,  or  site  of  this  time.  These  Native  Americans  are
believed  to  be  the  successors  of  the  prehistoric  Anasazi,  Hohokam,
and  Mogollon.  The  lowercased  form  is  a  term  for  village,  applied 
to the sites in the American southwest where the Pueblo lived. Often 
these  were  apartment-like  complexes  of  rectangular  living  rooms,
built close together and often arranged in several stories or terraces,
and made of wattle and daub. This building style is especially asso-
ciated with the Anasazi tradition. The chronological period followed
the Basketmaker and was divided into ﬁve stages at the 1927 Pecos
Conference:  Pueblo  I  (700–850/900),  Pueblo  II  (900–1100/1150),
Pueblo III (1100/1150–1300), Pueblo IV (1300–1600), and Pueblo V
(1600–1700s).

pulley: a wheel with a groove in it for a rope or cord, used to raise heavy

objects.

punch: a pointed tool, usually of bone, stone, or wood, used to perforate

a material such as hide or shell. [punching (n.)]

punctate decoration: decorations made using a pointed implement to press
designs into ceramics, sometimes making holes in an object. [punctate
decorated pottery]

punctating: impressing pottery repeatedly with the end of a stick, bone,

quill, cane, or other narrow tool. [punctate (adj.)]

Purron  phase:  in  the  Tehuacán  Valley,  Mexico,  a  phase  from  c.  2300
to 1500 bc, with food collecting and plant cultivation. The dates fall
between the end of the Abejas and start of the Ajalpan phases. In the
Purron phase, the ﬁrst pottery was produced in vessel forms that duplic-
ated earlier stone vessels.

Puuc: a region in the north central region of the Yucatán, Mexico, with
a distinctive Maya architectural style of 600–900 ad, the last variant
of the Classic Maya culture. The main characteristic of this style was
the  use  of  veneer  masonry  to  cover  rubble  and  concrete  walls,  and
the prefabrication of sculpted elements which were assembled to form
patterns  and  masks.  The  style  was  ﬂorid,  with  alternating  zones  of
plain and elaborately decorated carving; fret- and lattice-designs and
round columns were common; and there were many low, single-story
residential buildings. Mosaics have been found at Uxmal, one of the
best-known  Puuc  centers.  Puuc  architecture  has  also  been  found  at

PYXIS

259

Labná,  Kabah,  and  Sayil.  The  style  spread  all  over  the  northern
Yucatán and there are some structures at Chichen Itza. Puuc sites are
thought by some to represent a lowland Maya New Empire with its
apogee  in  the  9th  to  10th  centuries,  a  time  during  which  the  great
Petén, or central subregion, centers were in decline or had collapsed.
puzzle jug: a style of ceramic jug or pitcher from the 15th and 16th cen-
turies ad in Europe, pierced in several places as a challenge for the user.
pygmy  cup:  a  very  small  ceramic  vessel  in  a  range  of  shapes  of  Early
Bronze Age burials in northwestern Europe, usually in association with
an urn of some kind. [accessory vessels, incense cups]

pyramidal  core:  a  single  platform  core  that  tapers  away  from  the 

platform as a result of ﬂake removals.

pyxis:  in  Greek  antiquity,  a  cylindrical  canister-like  vessel  with  a  ﬂat 
shoulder and lid, used to hold trinkets. The name is more loosely applied
to lidded boxes in Greek archaeology.

Q

Quarry blank

quadrantal: an ancient square vessel used as a measure, the solid con-

tents of which were exactly equal to an amphora.

quarry blank: a rather small or medium-sized, thin, leaf-shaped piece of
ﬂint  that  could  be  mistaken  for  a  small  knife,  scraper,  or  triangular
notchless arrowhead.

quartz: a hard mineral of many varieties that consists primarily of silica
or silicon dioxide. Quartz has been important from the earliest times;
crystals  of  it  were  known  to  the  ancient  Greeks  as  krystallos.  It  is 
typically colorless to white, with some types having minor impurities
making it many different colors. Quartz has great economic import-
ance. Many varieties are gemstones, including amethyst, citrine, smoky
quartz, and rose quartz. Sandstone, composed mainly of quartz, is an
important building stone. Large amounts of quartz sand are used in
the manufacture of glass and porcelain and for foundry molds in metal
casting.  Quartz  is  the  second  most  abundant  mineral  in  the  Earth’s
crust after feldspar.

quartz  crystal:  pure  silicate  rock  crystal  that  is  usually  perfectly  clear
with six crystal surfaces. It may be used as a raw material for lithic
tool manufacture.

quartzite: metamorphic rock based on sandstone and consisting mostly
of quartz; it is dense hard rock that fractures concoidally. Flaked tools
were made of quartzite when there was no chert or ﬂint, and it was
important  for  heavy  monumental  building  stone.  Pebbles  of  it  were
made into hammerstones and hand axes. [sugar quartz]

Quaternary:  a  major  geochronological  subdivision  that  includes  the
Pleistocene (c. 1.8–2.45 million years bp) and Holocene (c. 10,000 bc)
epochs and was marked by the appearance of near-humans and Homo
sapiens. It is the second period of the Cenozoic geological era, following

QUIPU 261

the  Tertiary,  the  youngest  of  the  11  periods  in  Earth  history.  These
terms may also be applied to groups of deposits, which are described
as the Quaternary “system” and the Pleistocene or Holocene “series.”
The base of the Quaternary system is deﬁned by basal deposits that
overlie Pliocene deposits. The Quaternary was marked by repeated inva-
sions of vast areas of mid-latitude North America and northwestern
Eurasia  by  ice  sheets,  so  the  period  is  frequently  referred  to  as  the
Great Ice Age.

quenching:  in  metalworking,  rapid  cooling,  as  by  immersion  in  water,
brine, or oil, of a metal object from the high temperature at which it
has been shaped. The resulting metalwork is softer than when allowed
to cool slowly; this is important for iron and steel as quenching pro-
duces  a  different  structure,  which  is  much  harder  and  more  brittle.
Quenched steel can then be made less brittle by heating gently.

quern: large ancient grinding stone for grain or corn. A rough but hard
stone  was  necessary  to  avoid  grit  in  the  ﬂour.  Its  earliest  (Neolithic
before 5600 bc) form was the saddle quern, where material was ground
with  a  handstone  (or  muller)  on  an  immobile  concave  stone.  It  was
later replaced by the rotary quern (by Roman times), where one stone
is rotated on another by hand, animal, or wind power. Lava was widely
traded for this purpose. [rotary quern, saddle quern, true quern]

quillwork: a type of decoration for clothing and possessions character-
istic of certain North American Indian peoples, using softened and dyed
porcupine quills to make elaborate applied designs.

Quimbaya:  a  late  prehistoric  culture  of  western  Colombia,  South
America, dated ad 300–1600. It is known for its ﬁne goldwork – ﬂasks,
helmets,  jewelry,  pins,  etc.  It  represents  some  of  the  most  advanced
metallurgical techniques in the prehistoric New World. Pottery with
negative painting and incision, and sometimes modeled, belongs to the
ﬁnal centuries before the Spanish conquest. The Coclé region in Panama
was strongly inﬂuenced by the Quimbaya style. It is particularly known
for its striking gold pieces set with precious stones, including emeralds,
quartzes, jaspers, opals, agates, and green serpentines.

quinquereme:  a  Roman  and  Hellenistic  warship  which  was  larger  and
more powerful than its predecessor, the trireme. The quinquereme is
a galley with ﬁve banks of oars.

quipu:  a  mnemonic  device  used  by  the  Inca  for  keeping  accounts  and
records. It consisted of a number of thick cords of various thicknesses
and colors, on which numbers and other data were indicated by knots
of different sizes and positions on the strings. Based on a decimal sys-
tem, the color of the cord, as well as the size, conﬁguration, and place-
ment of each knot, had a special meaning. So complex was the system
that a special class of workers, quipu-camayoq (quipucamoyac), kept

the imperial records on quipus. The Incas did not have writing, but
quipus could also be used as aids in recording historical or liturgical
information accumulated by government. A modiﬁed form is still used
by some Andean herdsmen.

quiver: a holder for arrows.
quoit bead: a doughnut-shaped Early Bronze Age faience bead. [quoit-

shaped bead]

quoit brooch: an ornate circular Anglo-Saxon brooch of c. early 5th cen-
tury ad; a penannular brooch with a wide decorative plate with a hole
in the middle.

quoit-headed  pin:  Middle  Bronze  Age  pin  typical  of  the  Ornament
Horizon  in  northwest  Europe  (British  Taunton  phase)  comprising  a
thin shank with a point at one end and a large, rather ostentatious,
ring cast onto the shank at the other.

R

rabotage: the process of carefully scraping a horizontal surface to reveal
features in it distinguished by color differences. It is particularly use-
ful in sandy soils and gravels, revealing surprising detail.

racloir: a large scraper that has the retouched working edge along the
long  edge  of  the  ﬂake.  The  racloir  is  one  of  the  most  characteristic
Mousterian  implements  and  may  have  served  as  both  knife  and
(side)scraper. [sidescraper]

radial ﬁssure: tiny fracture lines that sometimes radiate away from the point
of percussion around the bulb on the ventral surface of a lithic ﬂake.
radial plane: the plane that radiates from the vertical axis of a pot’s (radial
or bilateral) symmetry or from the longitudinal axis of a tree or branch.
radiate: an imperial Roman coin on which the emperor is shown wear-
ing a radiate or pointed solar crown, especially in the 3rd century ad.
radiate brooch: a bow brooch with a semicircular headplate decorated

with a row of radiating knobs, found in Britain.

random  ﬂaking:  removal  of  ﬂakes  with  no  regard  to  the  resulting 

aesthetic alignment of ﬂake scars.

random sampling:  a  technique  in  which  a  sample  is  drawn  at  random
from a population, each member of it having an equal or other speciﬁed
chance  of  inclusion.  This  sampling  technique  is  based  on  a  totally 
random  selection  of  sample  units  to  be  investigated,  with  each  unit
having an equal chance of being selected.

rapier: a long, pointed, two-edged sword used for thrusting or cutting;
an offensive weapon of bronze distinguished from the sword by the
slenderness  of  its  blade.  It  developed  in  the  Middle  Bronze  Age  by
lengthening of the dagger, and was replaced by the slashing sword in
the Late Bronze Age of central and northwest Europe. In its later form,
it was a light, slender, sharp-pointed sword for thrusting only. [tuck]

264

RASP

rasp: a tool for smoothing objects.
rattle: any shaken instrument. Some are vessels containing pellets (maracas)
or  with  external  pellets  (cabaza),  some  slide  to  and  fro  (sistrum), 
others  clatter  together  (jingles)  or  whirl  round  cogs  (ratchet),  while
some swing in the breeze.

raw clay: extremely ﬁne particles, less than 0.002 mm across, forming
constituent components of natural and anthropogenic sediments and
deposits. The plastic raw material from which pottery, daub, bricks,
and other forms of terra cotta are made, comprising mainly clay-sized
particles of the principal clay minerals kaolinite, illite, and montmo-
rillonite. Potting clay is a relatively abundant and widespread resource,
although the quality and characteristics of different outcrops vary greatly,
the best being highly sought-after.

razor: a sharp-edged cutting instrument used especially for shaving the
face or other body parts; early razors were made by the Bronze Age.
reamer: a blacksmith’s tool of tapered square-sectioned rod, used to expand

a hole in a piece of metal.

reaping  hook:  an  iron  tool  shaped  like  a  long,  slightly  curved  knife, 
usually  with  a  single  blade  on  the  inner  face  of  the  curve,  and  used
for harvesting.

Recent: the epoch of geological time in the Late Quaternary following
the Pleistocene, referred to as the Holocene in several European coun-
tries. It is the present geological epoch, which began some 10,000 years
ago  (8300 bc).  The  Recent  epoch  is  marked  by  rising  temperatures
throughout  the  world  and  the  retreat  of  the  ice  sheets.  During  this
epoch,  agriculture  became  the  common  human  subsistence  practice.
During the Recent epoch, Homo sapiens diversiﬁed his tool technology,
organized his habitat more efﬁciently, and adapted his way of life. The
Recent stage/series includes all deposits younger than the top of either
the Wisconsinian stage of the Pleistocene series in North America and
the Würm/Weichsel in Europe.

reclamation  process:  transition  of  cultural  materials  from  the  archae-
ological record back into the systemic context; archaeological excava-
tion itself is reclamation.

recycle: to convert (waste) into reusable material.
red ocher: powdered iron ore placed in a burial area. [red ochre]
red polished ware: a ﬁne red ware with red or orange slip that is highly
burnished.  It  was  made  in  southern  Asia  in  the  ﬁrst  three  centuries
ad. It is often thought to be an imitation of the Roman Arretine ware.
The  characteristic  and  most  widely  dispersed  type  of  pottery  of  the
Roman Empire was the red, polished Arretine ware. Most Inca pot-
tery is also red polished ware.

red slipped: any pottery to which a slip, a thin layer of ﬁne clay, is applied
to pottery before ﬁring by dipping the pot into a thick liquid mixture

REFITTING

265

of clay and water. Slip decorates the fabric, is often chosen to bake
to a color such as red, yellow, or black, and makes the pot more water-
tight by clogging the pores of the earthenware.

red-ﬁgure:  a  technique  of  decorating  pottery  in  which  the  area  of  the
ﬁgure is left empty (reserved) and the detail is painted in. The red of
the  clay  contrasts  with  the  black.  It  is  an  important  phase  in  Greek
vase  painting,  the  inverse  of  black-ﬁgure  style,  and  it  started  in
Athens  in  the  late  6th  century  bc and  was  popular  to  the  4th  cen-
tury bc.  Other  local  schools  also  developed  in  the  late  5th  century,
especially in southern Italy, and continued until c. 300 bc. It was also
produced at Corinth. [red-ﬁgure ware; red-ﬁgured (adj.)]

reduced ware: a pottery fabric ﬁred in a “reducing” atmosphere or one
in which oxygen is denied, so that the iron in the fabric tends to form
magnetite rather than hematite. [reduced (adj.)]

reducing atmosphere: a term for pottery ﬁring conditions in which the
supply of air is limited or the fuel is damp. The fuel does not totally
burn under these circumstances and the gases contain carbon monoxide
rather than oxygen. This generally results in black-surfaced pottery as
opposed to the red produced in an oxidizing atmosphere, though shades
of color may vary if the conditions during ﬁring are not stable. Native
Americans and Mesoamericans understood the effect of a reducing atmo-
sphere, so that gray and black pots are found as well as the red and
brown ones ﬁred in an oxidizing ﬂame. [reduction]

reduction  sequence:  the  various  stages  that  a  stone  tool  goes  through
from  the  point  at  which  it  is  ﬁrst  struck  to  the  point  at  which  it  is
worked for the last time.

reductive  technology:  a  technology  where  an  artisan  acquires  material
(usually stone), and then shapes it by removing ﬂakes or other frag-
ments until it is fashioned into the ﬁnished product.

redware: earthenware pottery made of clay containing considerable iron

oxide.

reeding: regular horizontal grooving on the ﬂange of some types of mor-
taria and on the rim of some types of bowl; a small convex molding
or one of several set close together to decorate a surface; also, deco-
ration by means of reedings, the reverse of ﬂuting.

reﬁtting: the reassembling of stone debitage and cores to reconstruct ancient
lithic technologies. It is any attempt to put stone tools and ﬂakes back
together again, which provides important information on the processes
involved in the knapper’s craft. The reﬁtting or conjoining of artifact
or ecofact fragments, especially those of struck stone ﬂakes, to recre-
ate the original core, allows the deﬁnition of cumulative features, such
as the lithic artifact and debitage scatters. The technique may allow
reconstruction of ancient manufacture and use behavior. [conjoining,
rejoining, retroﬁtting; to reﬁt (v.)]

REFLEX  BOW

reﬂex bow: a small but powerful bow made such that, until strung, the
ends of the bow project forwards rather than backwards. The simple
bow, made from a single piece of wood, was known to Neolithic hunters;
it is depicted in cave paintings by 30,000 bc. The ﬁrst improvement
was  the  reﬂex  bow,  a  bow  that  was  curved  forward,  or  reﬂexively,
near its center so that the string lay close against the grip before the
bow was drawn. This increased the effective length of the draw since
it began farther forward, close to the archer’s left hand.

refractory: ceramic materials, usually high in alumina and silica, that can

withstand high temperatures and are slow to melt.

refuse:  any  materials  or  remains  left  behind  or  discarded  by  humans.

[garbage, trash]

Regional Development period: a term used in Ecuadorian archaeology
for  the  period  500 bc to ad 500,  when  local  adaptation  led  to  the 
proliferation  of  regional  cultures.  The  continuum  of  the  Formative,
Regional Development, and Integration periods has also been applied
to  neighboring  parts  of  South  and  Central  America.  Some  of  the
Ecuadorian coastal variants produced ﬁne pottery, elaborate ﬁgurines,
and many small art objects. There are hints of Asiatic inﬂuence in the
cultures of Bahía and Jama-Coaque, which occupied the coastland from
La Plata island to Cape Francisco. The period is characterized by changes
in sociopolitical organization and art styles and technology, which gave
rise to region-wide rather than purely local cultures.

regional sequence: a chronological series of phases within the limits of
a region, arrived at by correlating (not combining or conﬂating) local
sequences.

regional system: any system of time divisions such as those used in the
Americas,  based  on  major  technological  or  social  changes  that  pro-
duced regional cultures rather than local ones.

regnal year: a year reckoned from the date or anniversary of a monarch’s
accession  to  the  throne,  e.g.,  “in  his  eighth  regnal  year.”  At  times,
documents  were  dated  by  a  king’s  regnal  year.  Before  the  time  of
Alexander the Great, the ﬁrst regnal year was the new year following
the king’s accession.

regular ﬂaking: removal of closely aligned ﬂakes of similar lengths and

widths which results in an aesthetically pleasing ﬂake scar design.

reject: preforms that, because of some unsuitable ﬂaking qualities of the

stone or breakage, were discarded without being completed.

rejuvenated  core:  a  core  that  has  been  given  a  new  platform  once  it 
has  become  difﬁcult  or  impossible  to  remove  ﬂakes  or  blades  from
the previous one.

rejuvenated  platform:  cores  are  rejuvenated  by  removing  the  platform
to decrease the platform angle to allow blade production to continue.

RELIEF

267

The  core  is  struck  on  the  platform  and  blades  removed  to  create  a
new platform and to increase the angle between the platform and the
face of the core; a “core tablet” is struck off from the side of the core.
rejuvenation: restoring to an original or new state. [to rejuvenate (v.)]
relative chronology: a time scale developed by the law of superposition
or artifact ordering. It is the establishment of a chronology in which
occurrences can be placed in the correct sequence relative to each other
or to some known succession of events. Stratigraphy is the study of
the relative chronology of the Earth’s strata.

relative dating: dating methods where phases or objects can be put into
a sequence relative to each other, but which are not tied to calendr-
ically measured time. It is the sequencing of events or materials rela-
tive  to  another  but  without  linkage  to  ages  in  years  before  present
(bp) or calendar years. A relative date is a date which can be said to
be earlier than, later than, or contemporary with an event but which
(unlike  an  absolute  date)  cannot  be  measured  in  calendar  years.
When archaeologists say that event A occurred before or after event
B, they have a relative date for A. Before the advent of chronometric
dating  techniques,  all  dating  was  relative  except  where  links  with 
historical  events  could  be  proved.  Some  of  these  techniques,  mainly
stratigraphy  and  seriation,  are  still  useful  where  chronometric  dates
cannot  be  obtained.  Theoretically,  ﬂoating  chronologies  which  can-
not  be  tied  to  an  absolute  date  (e.g.,  certain  dendrochronological
sequences)  are  relative  chronologies  even  though  the  techniques  are
essentially chronometric.

relative time: temporal relationship between any two events or objects

– either later than, earlier than, or contemporaneous with.

relic: any object surviving from an earlier culture, especially a valuable
or symbolic object. In religion, a relic is the mortal remains of a saint
and  includes  any  object  that  has  been  in  contact  with  the  saint.
Christianity was governed throughout the Middle Ages by the belief
that  spiritual  virtue  could  be  transmitted  through  relics  of  a  person
who  in  life  was  blessed  with  miraculous  powers.  Cofﬁns  and  small
objects such as combs, jewelry, and clothing were commonly sanctiﬁed
and  subsequently  housed  in  beautiful  reliquary  caskets  or  shrines.
Ecclesiastical  centers  with  a  collection  of  relics  would  be  visited  by
large numbers of pilgrims, especially on saints’ days, when the objects
were put on special display and sometimes paraded.

relief: any sculpture in which the ﬁgures project from a supporting back-
ground or ﬂat surface. Reliefs are classiﬁed according to the height of
the ﬁgures’ projection or detachment from the background. In a low
relief, or bas-relief (basso-relievo), the design projects only slightly. In
a  high  relief,  or  alto-relievo,  the  forms  project  at  least  half  or  more

268

RELIEF

of their natural circumference from the background. Middle-relief, or
mezzo-relievo, falls roughly between the high and low forms. A vari-
ation  of  relief  carving,  found  almost  exclusively  in  ancient  Egyptian
sculpture, is sunken relief (also called incised relief), in which the carv-
ing is sunk below the level of the surrounding surface and is contained
within  a  sharply  incised  contour  line.  Intaglio,  likewise,  is  a  sunken
relief but is carved as a negative image like a mold instead of a posi-
tive (projecting) form. [raised bas-relief, relievo]

relief-bank amphora: a distinctive large storage jar made in the Rhineland
in  the  7th  century  ad,  mainly  at  Badorf  pottery  centers.  Each  was
strengthened with clay straps or bands and often used to carry Rhine
wine to other countries. As a result, there are many amphorae sherds
at  sites  in  Britain,  the  Netherlands,  and  Scandinavia.  The  Badorf
amphorae were probably made only until the 11th century, but similar
forms  were  by  then  being  produced  in  the  new  pottery  centers  at
Andenne and Limburg.

reliquary: a portable shrine, box, or casket in which the relic(s) of a saint
or other holy person were kept. A reliquary made to be worn around
the neck was called an encolpium or phylacterium.

Renaissance: the period in European civilization immediately following
the  Middle  Ages,  conventionally  held  to  have  been  characterized  by
a surge of interest in classical learning and values. It was the period
of rebirth of European intellectual curiosity about the natural world
and the role of humans in it, originating in the 15th century in Italy.
Changing social, political, and economic conditions, as well as the redis-
covery of classical texts, were basic to this rebirth.

repoussé:  a  jewelry-making  and  metalworking  technique  whereby  a
design is raised or embossed by hammering or punching out the metal
from  behind.  Repoussé  is  usually  done  on  bronze,  but  also  on  gold
and silver. It consists of hammering up the design from the back of
the  object  using  round-edged  punches.  The  surface  of  the  raised
design can then be decorated. Further work on the design can be done
using chisels and punches on the front of the sheet – a technique known
as chasing.

reserve head: a type of funerary sculpture of the Egyptian Old Kingdom,
found  mainly  in  tombs  at  Giza,  and  considered  by  some  to  be  true
portraits  of  the  deceased.  They  consist  of  a  limestone  human  head,
usually with excised (or unsculpted) ears and enigmatic lines carved
around the neck and down the back of the cranium. [portrait head]
residual clay: a clay weathered in place, remaining in association with
its parent rock; a primary clay as distinguished from a secondary clay.
residue: preserved foreign material, generally on an artifact such as pot-

tery or basketry.

REVERSE

269

resist: a material that a potter applies to the surface of a vessel to pre-
vent the adhesion of slip, paint, or glaze, so that the uncoated regions
will contrast with the coated ones.

reticulated work: in masonry, it is a type of facing used on ancient Roman
concrete  or  mortared  rubblework  walls.  It  appeared  during  the  late
Roman Republic and succeeded the earliest type of facing, which was
an irregular patchwork called opus incertum. Reticulated work looks
like a diagonal checkerboard with its square stones set lozenge fashion,
separated by relatively ﬁne joints. In porcelain production, it is a tech-
nique in which the outer side is entirely cut out in geometric patterns
– such as honeycomb or intercrossed circles – and superimposed onto
a second vase of similar or of cylindrical form. [opus reticulatum, retic-
ulated porcelain]

retort: a glass vessel with a long tapering neck that is bent down; it is

used for distillation.

retouch: the working of a primary ﬂint ﬂake after its preliminary rough-
ing-out,  usually  by  the  removal  of  small  fragments,  to  form  a  func-
tional tool; to thin, sharpen, straighten, or otherwise reﬁne an existing
stone tool for further use. In the case of a core tool, such as a hand
ax, retouch may consist of roughly trimming the edge by striking with
a hammerstone, but on smaller, ﬁner ﬂake or blade tools it is usually
carried out by pressure ﬂaking. It is done two ways, either by blows
that knock small ﬂakes off an edge (percussion retouch) or by pres-
sure to force the ﬂakes off (pressure retouch). The different types of
retouch are also described as backing or blunting retouch, and inva-
sive or normal retouch. Invasive retouch can be steep or shallow, depend-
ing mainly on the kind of edge being retouched; this retouch can also
be scaly in character. Backing is most often applied to blades and may
have been done to blunt the back or to bring its end to a stout point.
Evidence suggests that it may have been done to regularize the blade
edge  to  facilitate  ﬁxing  by  resin  “mastic”  to  a  bone  or  wood  shaft.
Such a strip of mastic was found in Lascaux, France. Notching or tooth-
ing is another form of retouch, and the removal of spalls or slivers as
in the burin technique could be regarded as a further form of retouch
or modiﬁcation. Retouch is one of the most obvious features distin-
guishing a manmade from a naturally struck ﬂint. [secondary ﬂaking,
secondary working]

retouched  ﬂake:  a  ﬂake  that  has  had  small  ﬂakes  removed  to  blunt,

sharpen, reﬁne the outline, or prepare the edge of the tool.

re-use process: transformation of materials through successive states within
the behavioral system. Potsherds, for example, are sometimes ground
up to be used as temper in making new vessels.

reverse: the back of a medal or coin.

270

REVERSE  FACE

reverse face: on a ﬂuted projectile, it is the face from which the secondary

ﬂute was removed.

reworking: ﬂaking applied to a broken or dulled tool so as to reclaim
it for additional use. Reworking was the characteristic means by which
an implement was resharpened. Alternate and bifacial beveling, serra-
tion, and other diagnostic features of blade renewal are very import-
ant  to  age  determination,  as  well  as  for  the  purpose  of  assembling
attribute clusters for typological analysis. Typically, reworked blades
or  points  have  a  different  outline  than  their  former  pristine  outline.
The reworking of lithic objects was employed by early humans due to
the general lack of high-quality lithic materials. [lateral rejuvenation]
Rhenish ware: pottery imported into Britain from Gaul and the Rhineland
during the late 2nd century ad onward, having a thin red paste and
a black metallic color coat, sometimes decorated with scrolls, indented
rouletting, or words in white paint.

rhyolite: a ﬁne-grained, light-colored volcanic rock, chemically identical
to obsidian. Its color may range from white, through gray, and yellow
to reddish-pink. It was sometimes used as a raw material for lithic tools.
rhyton: a Greek vessel of earthenware, metal, or stone, and sometimes
in the form of an animal head. It was a deep vessel with a single han-
dle intended for the pouring of libations or liquid offerings to gods,
spirits of the dead, etc. The mouth at the upper end is often balanced
by  a  hole  at  the  lower  end.  It  is  presumed  that  the  covering  of  this
aperture  by  the  celebrant  would  control  the  pouring  of  the  libation
until  the  right  moment  in  the  ceremony.  Rhytons  were  often  made 
of precious materials and of elaborate form. They are typical of the
Minoans, Mycenaeans, and Classical Greeks, and of the Achaemenid
Persians. It is technically a ritual vessel, found from the Bronze Age
onward.

ribbing: a rib-like structure or pattern.
ribbon torc: a gold neck ornament of the Middle Bronze Age c. 1200–
900 bc of  northwestern  Europe.  It  is  a  circlet  of  twisted  metal  with
hooks and balls at the terminals to fasten the ends together.

ridge: a raised, angular band, line, or strip about the neck of a vessel.
ridge tile: stone or ceramic tiles set along the ridgeline of a roof, usually

shaped to sit over the ridge itself to make a watertight seal.

riemchen: a rectangular, square-sectioned brick used in the late Uruk period
of  Mesopotamia.  It  was  used  to  build  bonded  walls  and  make  pat-
terns on the facades of public buildings. [Riemchen]

Rillaton: a gold cup found in a Wessex culture grave in Cornwall, south-
west  England,  from  the  Bronze  Age.  It  is  one  of  the  ﬁnest  pieces  of
Wessex culture craftsmanship found – made of sheet gold, strengthened
with corrugations, and with an S-shaped proﬁle and a single handle.

RISS  GLACIATION

The burial was a stone cist beneath a burial mound. The cup is dated
to c. 1650–1400 bc. [Rillaton cup]

rilling: the nearly horizontal, spiral ridges or striations around the interior
or  exterior  surface  of  a  vessel  thrown  on  a  wheel,  formed  by  ﬁnger
pressure in “lifting” the clay. [throwing marks]

rim: portion of a vessel closest to its oriﬁce and usually near the top of the
vessel, between the lip or margin and the side wall or neck of a vessel;
also, a sherd from this vessel part. Types of rim include simple or plain,
hooked, upright, everted, bead, ﬂange, and grooved cornice.

rim and lip stance: shape of the rim and lip of a ceramic vessel relative

to the rest of the object.

rim edge treatment: treatment of the rim edge that includes angular ﬂatten-
ing, horizontal ﬂattening, horizontal and vertical ﬂattening, pushing,
squeezing, and pinching.

rim sherd: a fragment of the rim of a pottery artifact. [rim shard]
rim  stance:  this  can  be  everted,  ﬂared,  horizontal,  incurving,  inverted,

pendant, T-shaped, vertical, or thickened.

rind: deeply patinated or weathered surface of a nodule or other piece

of stone, ﬂint, chert, or other material.

ring: a small circular band, typically of precious metal and often set with
one or more gemstones, worn on a ﬁnger as an ornament or a token
of marriage, engagement, or authority.

ring building: a type of coiling in which individual coils or annular rings

are placed as separate “courses” to build up a vessel.

ring neck: a ﬂagon neck of a series of superimposed horizontal rings.
ring-headed  pin:  slender  shaft  made  of  bronze  or  iron  with  a  point  at
one end and the other end bent to form a loop or ring, from the Middle
and Later Iron Age in the British Isles.

Rinyo-Clacton: name formerly used for a Late Neolithic pottery style of
Britain now known as Grooved ware. It was so-called after two widely
separated ﬁndspots (Clacton in Essex and Rinyo in the Orkney Islands).
[Grooved ware]

ripple: a wavelike undulation visible on ﬂakes that results from the trans-

mission of a shockwave through glass or chert.

ripple ﬂaking: a style of secondary ﬂaking of ﬂint and stone tools in which
a series of small elongated ﬂakes are removed from the surface of the
tool being made so that each new ﬂake scar cuts into the edge of the
last one, producing a corrugated or rippled surface.

rippled decoration: a technique of pottery burnish in which the whole
surface is worked into ripples, in extreme examples it approaches ﬂuting.
[ripple burnishing]

Riss  glaciation:  the  third  major  glaciation  of  the  Pleistocene  in  Alpine
Europe and the penultimate Alpine glacial advance. It started 250,000

272

RISS  GLACIATION

years ago and lasted over 100,000 years. The Riss, during which moun-
tain glaciers descended from the highlands, followed the Mindel-Riss
interglacial stage and preceded the Riss-Würm interglacial stage, both
periods of relatively moderate climatic conditions. The Riss is corre-
lated with the Gipping glacial stage of Great Britain and the Saale glacial
stage of northern Europe. Like the Saale, the Riss glacial stage included
two major phases of ice advance separated by a period of more mod-
erate conditions. It is roughly contemporaneous with the Illinoian glacial
stage of North America.

Riss-Würm interglacial stage: a major division of the Pleistocene in Alpine
Europe and a period of relatively moderate climatic conditions, that
followed the Riss glacial stage and preceded the Würm glacial stage
– both periods of deteriorating conditions. The Riss-Würm is corre-
lated with the Eemian interglacial stage of northern Europe and the
Ipswichian interglacial stage of Great Britain. It is broadly equivalent
to the Sangamon interglacial stage of North America.

ritual  vessel:  any  object  made  and  intended  for  the  worship  of  ances-
tors, who are often named in inscriptions on the object, and usually
made of bronze. Many were specially cast to commemorate import-
ant events in the lives of their possessors. The vessels were also meant
to serve as heirlooms. Although ritual vessels are found in many parts
of the ancient world (e.g., rhytons or libation vessels of the Greek Bronze
Age),  they  were  particularly  important  in  China  –  where  they  were
used for sacriﬁces of food and wine offered to ancestors. The bronze
ritual  vessel  is  the  characteristic  artifact  of  the  Chinese  civilization.
Many are found in the tombs of Shang and Zhou/Chou dynasties, made
almost exclusively by casting. Beginning in the Anyang period (c. 1300–
1030 bc), vessels were often cast with inscriptions dedicating them to
the service of deceased ancestors; hence the sacriﬁcial offerings of wine
and  food  presented  in  the  vessels  were  connected  with  the  ancestral
cult known also from the Anyang oracle bone inscriptions. The practice
of providing imposing vessels as mortuary gifts, and perhaps even the
ancestral cult itself, originated in the east-coast Neolithic tradition, where
some of the Shang vessel shapes have precursors in pottery and where
important Shang cultural traits are foreshadowed as early as the 4th
millennium bc. The vessel types are known today either by names given
to them in Shang or Zhou/Chou times that can be identiﬁed in con-
temporary  inscriptions,  such  as  the  li,  ting,  and  hsien,  or  by  names,
such as yu, chia, and kuang, given them by later Chinese scholars and
antiquarians. The vessels may be grouped according to their presumed
function in sacriﬁcial rites.

rivet: a small metal rod used to attach a metal blade to its haft (such as
the handle of a bronze dagger) or to fasten two sheets of metal together.
Each end of the rivet is burred over (spread and ﬂattened) by hammer-

ROOF  FURNITURE

ing  after  it  has  been  passed  through  the  two  elements  to  be  joined.
Riveting is also a method of making joints in metalwork. In antiquity,
riveting was used to make such artifacts as helmets or situlae.

rock: an aggregate of one or more minerals that can be deﬁned by both
physical properties and mineral content. The three forms are: (1) igneous,
rock that has cooled from a molten state; (2) sedimentary, rock that
has formed through the accretion of sediments; and (3) metamorphic,
rock formed from pre-existing rocks subjected to extreme heat, pres-
sure, or chemical change.

rock  art:  painting  and  engraving  on  rock  or  cave  surfaces,  done  for 
decoration,  the  depiction  of  narratives,  or  for  religious  purposes.
There are petroglyphs (carvings on rock faces), engravings (incisions),
and pictographs (paintings on rock surfaces). A great deal of rock art
occurs  throughout  the  African  continent.  In  contrast  to  the  painted
caves of Europe, the African art takes the form either of paintings in
rock  shelters  (not  in  caves)  or  engravings  on  open  rock  outcrops  or
boulders.

rocker pattern: a type of pottery decoration in which a straight or curved
edge  is  moved  across  the  soft  clay  by  pivoting  on  alternate  corners,
the result being a zigzag of curved lines. The technique was discovered
and employed in a number of different times and places – Neolithic
Impressed ware of the central Mediterranean, the Iron Age of the Sudan
and of Manchuria, in North America (Hopewell), and widely in the
Pre-Classic cultures of Middle and South America.

rod: term applied to a type of Mesolithic microlith found especially in
northwestern Europe. Rods are rounded forms of microliths retouched
along the edges.

rolled: the battered, abraded condition of ﬂint or stone tools that have
been moved by water or glacial action and have then been incorpor-
ated into terrace gravels or glacial tills.

roller-stamping:  a  pottery  technique  in  which  a  cylinder-shaped  roller
with an incised pattern is rolled over the surface of the vessel while
it  is  leather-hard.  A  repeating  pattern  of  the  design  on  the  roller  is
produced in “negative.” [rouletting (adj.)]

Roman period: period of Roman political and military control, generally
between 200 bc and ad 400, but varying for different regions depend-
ing on the date of conquest.

Romano-Saxon ware: wheelmade Roman pottery in coarse or color-coated
fabrics with stamped or bossed decoration, as well as Saxon pottery
imitating  Roman  forms,  of  eastern  England;  the  former  around  the
late 3rd and 4th centuries.

roof furniture: any decorative and functional features of a roof such as
ﬁnials on gables, anteﬁxes for hollow tiles at the eaves, chimney pots,
louvres, or smoke turrets.

274

ROOF  SLATE

roof slate: a thin rectangular piece of stone of a type that splits into a

thin ﬂat piece, used as a rooﬁng material.

rooﬁng  nail:  a  nail  with  a  large,  often  galvanized,  head,  used  to  hold

composition rooﬁngs.

rope: a length of cord usually made from twisting ﬁbers together which

increases the strength of the rope.

rosary:  a  string  of  beads  used  to  aid  the  memory  in  reciting  a  set  of 

devotions.

Rosegate series point: a bifacially worked chipped stone projectile point
of Archaic people in the Great Basin of North America, c. ad 700–
1300. This point had a triangular outline, small corner notches, and
a basal tang. [East Gate, Rose Spring]

Rosetta Stone: a basalt stela discovered at Rosetta, at the western mouth
of  the  Nile,  during  Napoleon’s  occupation  of  Egypt,  in  1799.  This
trilingual inscription on stone, a decree of King Ptolemy V (196 bc),
was carved in Greek, Egyptian demotic, and Egyptian hieroglyphic. It
provided Jean-François Champollion with the key to the decipherment
of the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, thus paving the way to modern
Egyptology. The Rosetta Stone is now in the British Museum.

rosso  antico:  a  salt-glazed  red  stoneware  (red  porcelain)  produced  by

Josiah Wedgwood in the 18th century.

rostro-carinate: a term for an eolith shaped like a bird’s beak.
rotary quern: a small handmill used to grind grain into ﬂour, consisting
of two circular stones, dating from the Roman times. Grain was poured
into  a  central  hole  in  the  top  stone,  which  was  then  turned  with  a
wooden handle. The grain would get crushed between the two stones
as the upper stone was turned, and emerge from between the two as
a coarse ﬂour.

roughcast ware: a type of pottery decoration created by small particles
of dried clay or gritty material being dusted over the surface of a vessel,
often under a slip coating.

roughout: an early stage in the making of bifacially chipped stone tools.
Roughouts  were  often  manufactured  in  quarry  areas  and  later
reworked into ﬁnished artifacts elsewhere.

rouletting: a technique used to decorate pottery. In Greek pottery mak-
ing, it began in the early 4th century bc. A strip of metal was applied
to  the  pot  as  it  was  turned  on  the  wheel,  leaving  a  band  of  even 
decoration  on  the  inside;  this  is  more  accurately  called  chattering.
Alternatively, a cogged wheel was rotated over the soft clay of a pot
to leave a series of impressed dashes at right angles. This method was
used  especially  on  Roman  pottery  and  is  found  on  the  exterior  of 
vessels, particularly on the rim. In India, the technique was used on
pottery of rougher fabric and on forms derived from Northern Black

RUSTICATION

Polished  wares,  possibly  beginning  in  the  late  1st  millennium  bc.
The pre-Columbian civilization of the Chavín also used rouletting on
its pottery. [chattering, roller-stamping, roulette]

rounded: a term used to describe a basal edge that has a rounded stem
outline; also used to describe a point which is not of a sharp or barb
type.

roundel: a circular panel containing a design, as on a mosaic.
rounding: in pottery, rounding terms used are: angular “convex shape, sharp
corners;” subangular “convex shape, rounded-off corners;” rounded
“convex shape, no corners;” irregular “convex/concave shape;” or ﬂat
“two-dimensional shape.”

rove: a small metal ring through which a nail or rivet is passed and ﬁxed.
rune:  an  angular  script  for  carving  on  wood  or  stone  developed  by
Germanic  peoples  (northern  Germany,  Scandinavia)  around  the  4th
century ad through contact with Mediterranean alphabets. The early
alphabet,  with  24  letters  divided  into  three  groups  of  eight,  was
mainly used for short commemorative or magic protective formulae.
A simpliﬁed alphabet of 16 characters was developed in Scandinavia
from the 9th century, and this was used for more elaborate inscrip-
tions, continuing for a long period in the Middle Ages. The etymology
of the word means “secret,” “mystery,” “counsel,” and “charm.” It is
ﬁrst  recorded  in  Denmark  and  Schleswig  and  spread  widely  across 
northern Europe. The voyages of the Vikings later carried it as far as
Russia  and  Iceland,  where  it  remained  in  use  into  the  Middle  Ages.
There  are  no  substantiated  runic  inscriptions  from  the  New  World.
A rune stone is a freestanding memorial stone with an inscription in
runes. Runes are also associated with ceremonial artifacts, but can also
be seen as grafﬁti.

rune stone: a freestanding memorial stone with an inscription in runes,
developed by Germanic peoples around the 4th century ad. Rune stones
from the Viking period are found throughout Scandinavia. [rune-stone,
runestone]

Rustic ware: a pottery type made principally in northern Britain using
a technique still occasionally used on ﬂower pots today. Barbotine is
applied to the ware and a ﬁnger is put on the wet clay and lifted off,
so the clay has ﬁnger forms in ridges and then a point. The term also
refers to pottery made by Frenchman Bernard Palissy, who from about
1548  produced  large  earthenware  dishes  decorated  with  naturalistic
pictures in high relief. The wares were colored with lead glazes and
Rustic ware was imitated by potters in France, Portugal, and England.

rustication: in pottery decoration, the roughening of the surface of a pot
which may or may not have an applied slip. The roughening may be

276

RUSTICATION

achieved using ﬁngers, ﬁngernails, twigs, etc., and though it may be
pure  decoration,  in  most  cases  it  is  probably  a  device  to  prevent  a
greasy  pot  slipping  through  the  ﬁngers.  On  some  pieces,  a  grit  such
as ﬂint may actually be added to the roughened clay to give additional
grip. [rusticated]

Ruthwell Cross: a cross with an important English-language runic inscrip-
tion, from the Dumfries region of Scotland. The cross, an example of
Northumbrian art of the early 8th century, stands more than 5.5 m
(18  feet)  high.  It  is  carved  with  Gospel  scenes  and  twining  vines, 
as well as 18 verses of The Dream of the Rood. The inscription has 
linguistic signiﬁcance because it contains six runic symbols indicating
guttural sounds, whereas the Scandinavians employed only one or two.
Much  of  the  inscription  is  also  copied  in  Latin.  It  is  now  preserved
in the interior of the parish church at Ruthwell in Northumberland,
northeast England.

Saale: a division of Pleistocene deposits and time in northern Europe which
followed  the  Holstein  interglacial  stage  and  preceded  the  Eemian
interglacial stage. It was the penultimate cold stage in northern Europe,
c. 200,000–125,000 bp. The extensive and complex Saale deposits are
correlated  with  the  Wolstonian  (or  Gipping)  glacial  stage  of  Britain
and  the  Riss  glacial  stage  of  the  European  Alpine  region.  The  Saale
is roughly contemporaneous with the Illinoian glacial stage of North
America. The Saale has three complex phases: the Drente, Treene, and
Warthe substages. The Drente and Warthe represent periods of glacial
advance, or maxima, whereas the Treene represents an interstadial period
of glacial retreat between the early Drente and the late Warthe. In the
region  of  central  Europe,  the  Saale  is  represented  by  three  glacial 
maxima  separated  by  two  periods,  or  interstadials,  of  moderating 
climatic  conditions.  One  of  the  main  features  is  a  complex  series  of
end moraines, demarcating the maximum extent of ice sheets. These
ice  sheets  ﬂowed  out  from  centers  in  Scandinavia,  across  the  Baltic
Sea and into northern Europe and Russia. The end moraines are split
into  two  sets:  the  Drenthe  moraines  (or  Dnieper)  and  the  Warthe
moraines (Moscow in the USSR). These formations are complex and
each  seems  to  represent  several  “pulses”  of  the  ice-sheet  edge.  The 
Saale  glacial  stage  was  named  for  the  German  river,  a  tributary  of 
the Elbe.

saber: a curved sword designed to cut with, and used by the cavalry. [sabre]
saddle quern: ancient device for milling by pounding, using a round stone
rolled or rubbed on a ﬂat stone bed. It is the earliest known example,
along with the mortar and pestle, of milling equipment and was invented
in  Neolithic  times  (before  5600 bc).  It  consisted  of  a  large,  slightly
concave, lower stone and a smaller upper stone. Grain spread on the

278

SADDLE  QUERN

surface of the lower stone was ground by being rubbed over with the
upper stone.

saex: a single-edged knife or cleaver, found in Saxon and Anglo-Saxon

graves in the late 6th century ad onward.

saggar: a container made of refractory clay that was used to protect clay
articles and glazes from ﬂames and gases during ﬁring. [sagger, seggar]
Saintonge ware: major pottery industry in the region of Saintes in west-
ern France from the 13th century until recent times. The best known
of these wares are the tall jugs with polychrome glazed decoration which
appear to have been traded with western French wine to the English.
The  jugs  exported  were  only  one  of  the  variety  of  wares  made  at 
centers  like  La  Chapelle  des  Pots,  where  kilns  and  workshops  have
been excavated. Saintonge was originally the territory inhabited by the
Santones, a Gallic tribe.

Saladoid  series:  a  group  of  related  pottery  styles  found  along  the
Orinoco River in Venezuela and named after the type site at Saladero.
Saladoid pottery is thin and ﬁne, painted with white or red designs,
especially  white-on-red.  The  utilitarian  wares  include  ﬂat  plates  or 
griddles for making manioc bread. The everted bell, often with tabu-
lar lugs, is the favored vessel form. The Saladoid tradition may have
begun before 2000 bc and lasted in some areas up to c. ad 1000. Some
Saladoid groups migrated to Trinidad, the Virgin Islands, and the Antilles
during  the  early  centuries  ad,  and  this  movement  may  represent the
Arawak colonization of the West Indies. [Salader, Saladero]

Salinar:  a  pottery  style  that  followed  Cupisnique  in  the  Chicama  and
Virú Valleys of north Peru, c. 200 bc to ad 200. It is distinguished
by modeled vessels, pots with stirrup spouts, and whistling jars. Some
vessels have simple white patterns over a red slip. The transition from
Cupisnique is evidenced in a shift from reduced-ﬁred to oxidized-ﬁred
ceramics and the introduction of new forms and decorative techniques.
Salinar introduced the handle-and-spout vessel, although the Chavinoid
stirrup-spout form continued. The characteristic decoration was broad,
white, painted bands and dots, sometimes outlined with incision. Salinar
gave way to the Gallinazo and then Mochica styles.

salt-glazed stoneware: stoneware affected by the addition of salt to the
kiln gases during ﬁring. The bodies of the vessels are ﬂuxed with the
silicas  to  form  a  soda-glass  glaze.  A  brown-colored  surface  can  be 
created by coating the vessels in a thin iron wash before ﬁring.

Samian ware: a distinctive Roman pottery produced mainly in south and
central Gaul and the Moselle Valley in the ﬁrst century bc and ﬁrst
three  centuries  ad;  later  it  was  made  in  Britain  (Colchester).  It  was
copied from Italian Arretine ware and was itself widely imitated. It is
a red ware with a bright glossy surface, plain or elaborately decorated

by means of molds. The decorations, shape, and fabric, as well as the
potter’s  stamp,  all  help  in  dating  and  tracing  its  origin.  The  shapes
come from metal prototypes. The forms, decorations, and stamps have
allowed a detailed chronology to be established, which has provided
a  valuable  means  of  dating  the  other  archaeological  material  found
with them. [Roman Samian ware, terra sigillata, terra sigillata ware]
sand: a term describing the size of sediment or soil particles 0.06–2 mm in
diameter (British Standard 1377). The term has no implications of color,
organic content, or any property other than particle size or texture.
sand glass: a reversible device for measuring time by the transfer of sand

from an upper to lower glass bulb. [hourglass]

Sandia point: type site for a tanged and unﬂuted projectile point in New
Mexico’s Sandia Mountains. This cave has yielded artifacts of the so-
called “Sandia Man” (25,000 bc). In Pueblo mythology the Sandias
were  sacred,  marking  the  southern  boundary  of  the  Tiwa-speaking
Indian territory. Sandia points are stratiﬁed below Folsom points but
the radiocarbon dates of before 20,000 bc are often discounted, the
true date probably falling in the range 12,000–8000 bc, overlapping
with the Clovis. Associated fauna of bison, mammoth, and mastodon
suggest  contemporaneity  with  the  Llano  complex.  Sandia  type  I  has
a  lanceolate  blade  without  ﬂuting  and  without  the  concave  base  of
Clovis/Folsom  and  a  shoulder  to  one  side  of  the  base  of  the  blade,
suggesting knife use. Sandia type II has a rounded base. [Sandia pro-

sandshaker:  a  container  for  sand  which  was  used  to  stop  ink  from 

spreading.

sandstone: sedimentary rock consisting of sand or quartz grains cemented

together, typically red, yellow, or brown in color.

SANDWICH  GLASS

sandwich  glass:  any  of  various  forms  of  glassware  manufactured  at

Sandwich, Massachusetts, from 1825 to c. 1890.

Sangamonian: as an “age,” the Sangamon is a major North American
geochronological subdivision of the Pleistocene epoch, from c. 125,000
to 75,000 bp. The Sangamon comprises a range of sediments, includ-
ing  organic  sediment,  but  is  represented  mainly  by  a  warm  climate
palaesol, the Sangamon geosol, which overlies Illinoian-age tills and
is covered by Wisconsinan-age loess and tills. It appears to represent
one single interglacial. As a “stage,” it is a chronostratigraphic sub-
division of the Pleistocene.

sanukite: type of andesite produced by now-extinct volcanoes in the Inland
Sea area of Japan. It was used extensively during the Paleolithic and
postglacial periods (Jomon, Yayoi) for stone tools.

sarcophagus: a cofﬁn or sepulchral chest of stone, wood, lead, or terra
cotta, typically carved or inscribed and intended to be exposed to view.
In  Egypt  it  was  the  outermost  container,  with  one  or  more  wooden
cofﬁns  and  a  mummy  case  within.  Greek  for  “ﬂesh-eater”  or  “ﬂesh
swallowing,”  it  is  also  the  term  for  a  kind  of  limestone  reputed  to
consume the ﬂesh of dead bodies. In the Classical world, the term was
used  for  a  clay  or  marble  container  holding  a  corpse.  Many  were 
elaborately painted and, in the Roman period, elaborately carved.

Sarka style: a variant of the Linear pottery of western Bohemia, c. 3900 bc,
parallel to the Zeliezovce in Slovakia and southern Poland. The vessels
were painted in black spirals on buff before ﬁring.

Satsumon:  a  type  of  Haji-like,  incised-motif  pottery  made  in  early
Hokkaido and northern Honshu, Japan, from around the 4th to 14th
centuries ad; also the culture characterized by this pottery. Satsumon
houses were very much like late Kofun houses; iron tools were used
and cloth was woven. The Satsumon culture is seen as the transfor-
mation of a Jomon-type culture, which continued late in northern Japan,
as  the  result  of  contacts  with  Haji-using  people  to  the  south.  The 
people are thought to be the ancestors of the historic Ainu.

sauceboat: a drinking vessel of clay or metal made on mainland Greece

or in the Cyclades in the mid to late 3rd millennium bc.

saucer  brooch:  a  circular  concave  brooch,  often  decorated  in  chip-
carving,  of  the  north  German  lowlands  and  in  England,  c.  5th  and
6th centuries ad.

Savernake  ware:  a  Roman  pottery  made  from  the  time  of  the  Roman
conquest through the 2nd century ad, typically light gray, ﬂint-tempered,
and with clay pellets and grog visible in the fabric of jars, bowls, ﬂagons,
butt beakers, and platters.

Saxo-Norman pottery: British pottery made c. ad 850 through to 1150,

including Thetford ware, Stamford ware, and Winchester ware.

SCEATTA

scabbard: a sheath for a sword or the like.
scale armor: a form of armor made up of overlapping squares of pro-

tective material.

scaphium: a Greek vessel, small in size and in the form of a boat (scapha),

which was used as a drinking cup and was also sacriﬁcial.

scapula saw: an artifact made from the shoulder blade of a bighorn sheep

scapula shovel: a tool made from the shoulder blade of a large mammal
such as a cow, ox, or horse, especially created and used by Neolithic
communities in northern Europe.

scar: in stone tools, this is the negative impression left after the removal

or antelope.

of a ﬂake.

scar ridges: the boundaries of individual stone ﬂake scars.
scarab: an image or representation of a dung beetle (Scarabaeus sacer),
which was very common in ancient Egypt, especially on the Egyptian
stamp seal. It was in use from the Middle Kingdom (1938 to c. 1600 bc).
The  dung  beetle  was  held  sacred  by  the  ancient  Egyptians  as  a 
symbol of the motive power of the sun, which was equated with the
beetle’s ball of dung. It ﬁgured frequently in jewelry and other art forms
but is best known as the standard form of Egyptian stamp seals. These
are made of stone or faience in the shape of a beetle resting on a ﬂat
base, the underside of which is carved with a distinguishing inscrip-
tion  in  hieroglyphs  and  the  name  and  titles  of  the  owner.  The  back
of the seal was the dung beetle form. Scarabs were perforated length-
wise  and  were  worn  around  the  neck  or  as  a  ﬁnger  ring,  serving  as
an amulet as well as seal.

Scarlet ware: a type of red-and-black painted pottery used in the early
3rd millennium bc in the plains of eastern Mesopotamia, of the Early
Dynastic  period.  It  was  derived  from  Jemdet  Nasr  ware.  Geometric
designs in black on buff, separated by large areas of red paint, became
progressively more elaborate, in later stages including animal and human
ﬁgures in red outlined in black. There are hints of connections with
the wares of Baluchistan, especially in the elongated bulls.

sceatta: a small silver coin minted when the Anglo-Saxons reintroduced
currency into England in the 7th century ad. The earliest identiﬁable
ones are of Eorpwald of East Anglia (625–627) and Penda of Mercia
(625–654). The penny may owe its name to the latter. With this change
of  name  it  remained  the  standard  coin  from  the  reforms  of  Offa  of
Mercia (757–796) until the 12th century. Sceattas are distinctive because
they were made from pellets that were hammered between two dies,
not minted from a ﬂattened piece of metal (as after c. 790 in England).
The kings of Kent imitated these sliver coins in about 690, and issued
them  with  a  variety  of  designs  which  are  collectively  known  as  the

282

SCEATTA

primary  series  of  sceattas.  The  primary  series  is  virtually  conﬁned 
to Kent and ended about 720. The secondary series includes a wider 
variety of designs which occur over a larger area. [sceat]

scepter: in antiquity, a long staff similar to the shaft of a spear, carried
to  lean  on  when  walking.  It  eventually  became  the  truncheon,  a
weapon. Ornament was then added to the upper end of the staff, as
the  scepter  became  a  staff  or  baton  borne  by  a  sovereign  as  an
emblem of authority. [sceptre]

schist: a coarse-grained metamorphic rock that consists of layers of dif-

ferent minerals and can be split into thin irregular plates.

schist  hones:  whetstones  made  of  mica  schist  from  the  distinctive
Eisdorg rocks of southern Norway. They were widely distributed on
sites  around  the  North  Sea  throughout  the  medieval  period.  A  9th-
century boat carrying these hones was found near Kaupang.

scissors:  an  instrument  used  for  cutting  cloth  and  paper,  consisting  of
two crossing blades pivoted in the middle and operated by the thumb
and ﬁngers inserted in rings at each end.

scorper: a small, steel, metalworking tool with a broad sharp edge used
for removing the background from designs on metalwork to allow the
pattern to stand out. The tool could also be moved forward or back-
ward through the metal on alternate corners – thus producing a zigzag
or  tremolo  line.  It  is  likely  that  scorpers  had  to  be  made  of  iron  or
steel to work on bronze, and therefore they may belong to later stages
in the development of metalworking than tracers. In ancient minting,
engraving of the details was carried out by the use of scorpers. In wood
engraving, scorpers were used for cutting away large spaces after out-
lining and engraving, so as to leave only the drawing in relief.

scramasax: a single-edged knife often accompanying male Anglo-Saxon
burials; it was a cross between an iron hacking sword and a dagger,
with an angled back. It apparently served as a general purpose knife
or dagger. They commonly occur in Migration period and Anglo-Saxon
contexts until about the 10th century. They tended to become increas-
ingly elaborate: many were ﬁnely inlaid with a variety of metals and
some had very distinctive pommels.

scrape:  to  move  a  hard  or  sharp  edge  across  (a  surface),  especially  to

make something smooth; to apply (a hard or sharp edge).

scraper: a retouched ﬂake tool with a thick working edge; a ﬂake tool
that has been sharpened on one edge and left blunt on other edges to
allow grasping, probably used to scrape (dress) animal hides. It is called
a side scraper (racloir) or end scraper (grattoir) depending on the sharp-
ened edge – side scrapers utilize the long side and end scrapers have
the scraping facet on one end. Thumbnail scrapers are very small; some
cultures used scrapers as big as a ﬁst. Scrapers were also used in wood-

SCULPTURE

working and in shaping bone or ivory. Other types were snub-nosed,
round, or horseshoe. Side scrapers are typical of the Middle Paleolithic,
while end scrapers are typical of the later Paleolithic. [end scraper, end-
scraper, scraping tool, side scraper, sidescraper]

Scrapers

scraping: 1. Thinning the walls of a pottery vessel with a tool, such as
a mollusk shell or lithic ﬂake, held almost perpendicular to the sur-
face when the clay was nearly leather-hard. 2. Removing fat from the
interior of an animal hide using a stone tool.

scratch hardness: a measure of the relative hardness of pottery, obtained
by comparison with minerals of known hardness (Mohs scale): a min-
eral  harder  than  the  pottery  will  scratch  it,  but  it  will  be  unmarked
by a mineral that is less hard.

scratched decoration: pottery decoration in which lines are drawn with
a hard point, probably of ﬂint, on a burnished surface after the pot has
been baked. A thin but characteristically ragged line results, providing
for the inlay of ocher or plaster. The technique was used widely, notably
in the Neolithic of Italy (Matera and Lagozza) and France (Chassey).
screw:  a  spirally  grooved  object  used  to  join  two  or  more  materials

together.

screw neck: a ﬂagon or bottle with a continuous spiral groove around

the top for a stopper or seal.

scriber: a sharp-pointed metalworking tool used for outlining designs on
metalwork prior to chasing, engraving, or repoussé work. Occasionally
traces of this preliminary work can be seen where subsequent tooling
has not completely obliterated it.

scroll: a roll of paper or parchment, especially with writing on it.
sculpture: an art form including all carved work in wood, ivory, stone,
marble, metal, or other material and those works formed in a softer
material not requiring carving, such as wax or clay. It includes statuary,
carved ornaments, glyptics, incised gems, and cameos. The most ancient
specimens are carved of the hardest stones (basalt, granite, porphyry)
and done before the introduction of steel tools. [plastic art]

284

SEAL

seal: a device for impressing characteristic marks into a soft surface, such
as wet clay or wax, to indicate ownership or authenticity. Seals were
made of bone, ivory, stone, or wood and had an intaglio design and
were in the form of stamps or cylinder seals. Stamps can have a very
wide range of shapes, and give single impressions. Cylinder seals, char-
acteristic of ancient Mesopotamia, are rolled across the surface to yield
a frieze of repeat designs. Their social and linguistic signiﬁcance is great.
They were fundamental in the development of writing systems and were
a status symbol of authority and sometimes accorded talismanic pro-
perties. The use of seals and writing on clay tablets appeared together
in Mesopotamia, towards the end of the 4th millennium bc.

seal matrix: an object used to make impressions in wax as seals.
sealing rooﬁng nail: a nail with a lead or plastic washer under the head

to provide a watertight seal, used on metal rooﬁng.

sealing wax: wax used to seal letters, envelopes, documents, etc.
Second Intermediate Period: the time (1630–1540 bc) when groups of
Asiatic  people  appear  to  have  migrated  into  the  Egyptian  delta  and
established  settlements.  The  Second  Intermediate  Period  began  with
the  establishment  of  the  15th  dynasty,  called  the  Hyksos  (c.  1630–
1523 bc), with its capital at Avaris (Tall ad-Dab’a), and ended with
the 17th dynasty (c. 1630–1540 bc), ruling from Thebes. The Second
Intermediate  Period  was  the  consequence  of  political  fragmentation
and immigration and the time may have been somewhat impoverished.
secondary context: context of an archaeological ﬁnd that has been dis-
turbed by subsequent human activity or natural phenomena. The pro-
venience, association, and matrix of such archaeological data have been
wholly  or  partially  altered  by  transformational  processes  after  their
original deposition.

secondary ﬂake: a stone ﬂake removed from a larger ﬂake, as in the pro-
cess of reﬁning for a new use; a ﬂake possessing some cortex on its
dorsal aspect. The ﬂakes are removed from an existing stone tool in
order to thin, sharpen, blunt, or otherwise modify it for a speciﬁc use.
Secondary  ﬂaking  is  the  trimming  which  gives  a  chipped  stone  tool
its ﬁnal shape after the primary ﬂaking has produced a blank (blade,
ﬂake, or core) of roughly the required form. [partially cortical ﬂake,
reduction ﬂake, retouch, secondary ﬂaking, secondary retouch]

secondary ﬂaking: following the primary ﬂaking, this ﬂaking technique
was  applied  to  remove  medium-sized  pressure  or  percussion  ﬂakes 
in shaping the blade and basal edges, forming notches or producing
serrations.

secondary forming techniques: in ceramics manufacture, techniques used
to complete or reﬁne the shape of a vessel after primary forming either
the roughed-out vessel shape or the vessel’s components.

secondary prehistory: time when literate peoples came in contact with,

and wrote about, nonliterate peoples.

secondary refuse: unwanted objects or materials that were removed from
the site at which they were used and were disposed of at a different
location. This often included artifacts, bone, shell, and other habita-
tion debris, discarded away from the immediate area of use.

secondary retouch: ﬁnishing or resharpening ﬂaking done after the basic

shape of a lithic tool was completed.

sedimentary rock: rock that is the result of consolidation of sediments.
seed beater: an instrument usually made of wood or reeds that is formed

into a racket-like shape and used to strike seeds from bushes.

segment: small stone tool made on a blade or bladelet and shaped like
part of a circle; the backing is along a curved arc opposite a straight
unretouched  edge.  It  was  hafted,  possibly  as  a  projectile  tip  or  as 
part  of  a  cutting  tool.  Segments  occur  in  some  sub-Saharan  African
Howiesons Poort and Later Stone Age assemblages and are widespread
in North Africa. [crescent]

segmentation rule: a section of a snapped blade. A proximal segment is
where it preserves the striking platform; a distal segment includes the
distal end; and a medial segment lacks both ends.

self pipe: a stone or clay smoking pipe in which a stem is inserted into
the  mouth  of  the  smoker.  It  differed  from  stone  or  clay  pipe  bowls
into which a reed or wooden stem was inserted.

self-slip: a thin slurry of clay left on the surface of a pottery vessel as a

result of wetting the body during the vessel’s manufacture.

septal slab: an upright stone slab set across the ﬂoor of a megalithic cham-
bered tomb to divide it into separate compartments (e.g., in a court
cairn).  They  vary  in  height  from  low  kerbs  to  the  full  height  of  the
chamber; in the latter case they are sometimes provided with port-holes.
sequence:  a  series  of  periods  of  time  in  the  history  of  a  particular 
culture, each characterized by recognizably different material remains.
The  term  also  applies  to  the  arrangement  of  material  culture  into  a
time framework.

seria: a type of earthenware vessel used mainly for holding wine and oil

– larger than the amphora, and smaller than the dolium.

seriation:  a  temporal  ordering  of  artifacts  based  on  the  assumption 
that cultural styles change and that the popularity of a particular style
or decoration can be associated with a certain time period. [seriation
technique]

serpentine: a magnesium-rich silicate mineral occurring in a number of
forms and used for decorative work as they vary widely in color and
take on a high polish. Sources are known in the British Isles, Ireland,
Canada, US, New Zealand, and Afghanistan. Serpentine minerals were

286

also used in making ﬁne stone tools and vessels as well as jewelry and
architectural decoration.

Serra d’Alto: Neolithic village in Basilicata, Italy, on a hill defended by
three concentric ditches. It has yielded a distinctive painted pottery of
the  same  name,  c.  4500–3500 bc.  Geometric  designs  with  diagonal
meanders and solid triangles were painted in black or purple-brown
on a buff surface. A frequent motif is a zigzag line between parallels
(linea a tremolo marginato). Jars and handled cups are the standard
forms  and  the  elaborate  handles  are  horizontal,  tubular,  and  with
zoomorphic  additions  on  the  top.  In  the  later  phase,  a  thin  and
markedly splayed trumpet lug was adopted from the Diana ware of
Lipari.  The  high  quality  of  the  ware  and  the  fact  that  it  most  often
occurs  in  graves  and  other  ritual  contexts  suggests  that  it  was  pro-
duced for special purposes. It was traded over a wide area, occurring
in  Sicily,  Lipari,  Lake  Garda,  Malta,  and  in  central  Italy.  [Serra
d’Alto pottery]

Serraferlicchio  pottery:  a  site  near  Agrigento  in  southern  Sicily  which
has given its name to a style of pottery of the Copper Age (3rd millen-
nium bc). It is found mainly in rock-cut tombs and consists of a bright-
red  slipped  ware  decorated  with  black  paint  in  geometric  designs.
Characteristic forms are open bowls and a variety of jug and cup shapes.

serrated: possessing a notched or saw-tooth edge. [serration (n.)]
serrated point: an arrowhead with a serrated point, the edges with uni-

form small indentations in a sawtooth-like pattern.

serration: consecutive small teeth or barbs on the edge of a blade formed
by removing pressure ﬂakes. Biface serrations have ﬂakes removed from
both sides of the blade edge while uniface serrations have ﬂakes removed
from only one face of an edge. [serrated (adj.)]

sestertius: a Roman bronze coin, four equaling a denarius.
Severn  Valley  ware:  burnished  bowls,  jars,  tankards,  and  other  wares
from creamy buff to orange-red made at various centers along the Severn
in Great Britain.

Sevso  treasure:  a  hoard  of  Roman  silver  treasure  found  in  Yugoslavia

and Lebanon, named for the owner’s inscription on a dish.

sextant: an instrument for measuring the angular distance of objects, and

particularly used for navigation by noting the position of the stars.

sgrafﬁto ware: 1. Glazed vessels prepared ﬁrst by incising decoration in
the surface and then by adding paint in the incisions prior to the applica-
tion of glaze. There is a contrast between the brightly colored decora-
tion and the overall color of the glazed vessel. Byzantine sgrafﬁto wares
date  to  the  11th  to  12th  centuries  in  western  Europe.  It  was  not 
until the 16th to 17th centuries that the technique was established in
northern  Europe.  Sgrafﬁto  ware  was  produced  by  Islamic  potters 

Serrated point

and became common throughout the Middle East. The 18th-century
scratch blue class of English white stoneware is decorated with sgrafﬁto
patterns.  Sgrafﬁto  ware  was  produced  as  early  as  1735  by  German
settlers in colonial America. 2. A form of fresco painting for exterior
walls, done in Europe since the Middle Ages. A rough plaster under-
coat is followed by thin plaster layers, each stained with a different color.
These coats are covered by a ﬁne-grain mortar ﬁnishing surface. The
plaster is then engraved with knives and gouges at different levels to
reveal the various colored layers beneath. 3. A glass-decorating technique.
shabti: funerary ﬁgurine of Egyptian tombs from the Middle Kingdom,
usually  mummiform  in  appearance  and  carrying  agricultural  tools. 
It  developed  out  of  the  funerary  statuettes  and  models  provided  in 
tombs  of  the  Old  Kingdom.  The  shabti  was  intended  to  serve  as  a
replacement if the deceased was called upon to perform manual labor
in the netherworld. The ﬁnest examples are from the New Kingdom,
some  of  Saite  date.  Made  of  wood,  stone,  terra  cotta,  or  faience, 
such  statuettes  were  placed  in  the  tombs  often  in  large  numbers.
[shawabti, ushabti]

shackle: a restraining ring usually linked to another.
shaduf: an irrigation tool invented in ancient times, consisting of a long
wooden pole with a receptacle at one end and a counterbalancing weight
at the other, for transferring water out of a river or canal. This hand-
operated device is still used in India, Egypt, and some other countries
to  irrigate  land.  The  pole  is  mounted  like  a  seesaw,  with  a  skin  or
bucket hung on a rope from one end, and a counterweight hung on
the other. The operator pulls down on a rope to ﬁll the bucket and
allows the counterweight to raise the bucket. To raise water to higher
levels, a series of shadufs are sometimes mounted one above the other.
[denkli, paecottah, shadoof]

shaft hole: a hole in an implement or weapon to hold the haft. A shaft-
hole  ax  has  an  axhead  of  metal  or  stone  with  a  hole  through  it  for
hafting. Bronze axes and adzes from Mesopotamia of at least 2700 bc
are shaft-hole types, the hole for the handle being formed in a mold.
This method eliminated lashing the blades and permitted a heavier head
than the thin-bladed Egyptian models. Shaft-hole axes and adzes were
also being cast in Crete in about 2000 bc. The Beaker folk, Late Neolithic/
Early Bronze Age people living about 6000 years ago in Europe, also
used the shaft-hole battle ax. [shaft-hole axe]

shaft straightener: an artifact made from a coarse, often volcanic, stone,
with  a  groove  used  as  a  rasp  to  ﬁnish  spears  and  arrowshafts.  The
Mousterian industry used denticulate (toothed) instruments produced
by  making  notches  in  a  ﬂake,  which  were  perhaps  used  as  saws  or
shaft straighteners. [shaft-straightener]

SHALE

shale: ﬁne soft rock that splits easily and can be worked into ornaments
and trinkets. In northern Europe during prehistoric times, dark-colored
black and grey shales were sought after and used for making pendants,
rings, bracelets, etc. Sources include Kimmeridge, Dorset, and Whitby,
North Yorkshire. Kimmeridge shale was also widely used in Romano-
British times for ornaments and inlays. [jet]

shaman’s bundle: a parcel of sacred objects, often used in magic and/or
curing by a shaman, who is a person regarded as having healing powers
derived from supernatural sources.

shaping: in wheel-throwing pottery, a vessel that involves changing the
vessel diameter anywhere along its proﬁle without signiﬁcantly alter-
ing its height.

shatter: all angular waste resulting from stone toolmaking activities that

are not otherwise diagnostic. [angular shatter]

shave: to use a tool to remove thin slices of material from the ﬂoor or

face of an excavation unit.

shawabti:  funerary  ﬁgurine  of  Egyptian  tombs  from  the  Middle  King-
dom, usually mummiform in appearance and carrying agricultural tools.
It was developed out of the funerary statuettes and models provided
in tombs of Old Kingdom. The shabti was intended to serve as a replace-
ment if the deceased was called upon to perform manual labor in the
netherworld. The ﬁnest examples were from the New Kingdom, some
of Saite date. Made of wood, stone, terra cotta, or faience, such statu-
ettes  were  placed  in  the  tombs  often  in  large  numbers.  [Egyptian 
ushabti, shabti]

shear: a type of stress or force in which parts of a pottery body slip or

Shefﬁeld  plate:  copper  plated  with  silver,  especially  as  produced  in

slide relative to each other.

Shefﬁeld from 1760 to 1840.

shell: a hard, rigid, usually calcareous, covering or support of an animal
such as a mollusk. Many varieties of shell were used in antiquity, apart
from  the  use  of  their  contents  as  food.  Some  were  used  for  tools 
(oyster, conch) and others were made into jewelry or used for decora-
tive inlays. Others, such as ostrich eggshell and smaller seashells, were
used to make beads. Shells were perforated and strung on necklaces
since  at  least  the  Upper  Paleolithic.  It  is  frequently  found  in  tombs,
probably symbolizing the resurrection. Shell was traded widely to areas
where it was not locally available.

shell  tempering:  addition  of  small  pieces  of  crushed  shell  to  the  paste

used in creating a ceramic object.

shell-gritted ware: any pottery made from a fabric tempered with crushed

marine or fossil shell.

shengwen: pottery of early postglacial Cina, predating the Neolithic Cishan
and  Hemudu  wares.  It  is  coarse  with  a  textured  surface  decoration.
[sheng-wen]

sherd: any pottery fragment – piece of broken pot or other earthenware
item – that has archaeological signiﬁcance. Often abbreviated to sherd,
potsherds are an invaluable part of the archaeological record because
they are well-preserved. The analysis of ceramic changes recorded in
potsherds has become one of the primary techniques used by archae-
ologists  in  assigning  components  and  phases  to  times  and  cultures.
[shard, potsherd]

shield: a piece of armor carried in the hand or on the arm, usually the
left,  to  ward  off  weapons.  Examples  from  the  Bronze  and  Iron  Age
come from bogs and rivers of northwest Europe. In the Bronze Age,
shields  were  circular  and  made  of  wood  covered  with  bronze.  They
had a raised, dome-shaped boss in the center into the back of which
the hand ﬁtted, holding the grip. In the Iron Age, shields were some-
times  called  bucklers,  and  had  become  long  and  rectangular.  They 
were  made  of  bronze  and  were  embossed.  Some  were  enameled  in 
La  Tène  style  and  lined  with  wood  or  leather.  Leather  shields,  with
few  surviving,  are  functionally  more  efﬁcient,  and  wooden  ones  are
also  known,  notably  in  Mexico,  where  they  were  decorated  with 
feather mosaic.

shield-pattern palstave: a type of bronze palstave of the Industrial phase
of the British Bronze Age c. 1500–1250 bc, having a raised triangular-
shaped area cast below the stop ridge.

shingle:  a  rectangular  tile  of  asphalt  composite,  wood,  metal,  or  slate

shipwreck: remains of sunken ships, which are often investigated by under-

used on walls or roofs.

water archaeologists.

shivering: a pottery defect caused by compressive stress, resulting in incom-

plete coverage or peeling of the glaze.

shoeing nail: a nail of distinctive form, speciﬁcally used in the shoeing

of animals, e.g., horses, donkeys, and oxen.

shoe-last adze: a long, thin, chisel-shaped, ground-stone tool employed
by the Danubian farmers of the Early Neolithic, possibly as a hoe for
cultivating their ﬁelds. It is a common stone tool found in Early Neolithic
Linear pottery contexts throughout Europe. It might also have been
used as an adze for carpentry. [shoe-last celt]

shoulder: 1. The part on a vessel above the body’s maximum diameter
but below the neck or rim. 2. A notch on one side of a blade, creating
an asymmetrical outline; the area of an artifact that divides the blade
from the stem or hafting area.

290

SHOULDERED  ADZE

shouldered adze: a polished stone adze of the Neolithic period, distributed
along  the  coastal  area  of  China  from  Shantung  southwards  and  in 
central southern China. It was also prominent in Southeast Asia.

shouldered  point:  type  of  stone  point  made  on  a  blade,  with  a  notch 
on  one  side  of  the  base  and  ﬂaked  partly  or  wholly  on  both  sides.
Shouldered points are characteristic of some Upper Paleolithic cultures
of Europe, such as the Solutrean, Magdalenian, and Eastern Gravettian.
shrine: innermost element of a temple where the cult image or bark of the
deity  was  placed,  or  an  elaborate  box  containing  funerary  statuary.
It was a repository for relics – either ﬁxed, as a tomb, or movable, as
a feretory. A shrine can be a case, box, or receptacle, especially one
in which sacred relics (such as the bones of a saint) are deposited –
or  a  place  in  which  devotion  is  paid  to  a  saint  or  deity  (sanctuary).
A shrine can also be a niche containing a religious image, a receptacle
(such as a tomb) for the dead, or a place or object worshipped in asso-
ciation. [naos, per, sanctuary]

shroud: a sheet-like garment or covering used to wrap a corpse prior to

burial.

Shroud  of  Turin:  a  sheet  of  twill-woven  linen  cloth  on  which  appears 
a pale sepia-tone image of the front and back of a naked man about
6  feet  tall,  alleged  to  be  the  actual  cloth  in  which  Christ’s  cruciﬁed
body was wrapped. The images contain markings that allegedly cor-
respond to the stigmata of Jesus, including a thorn mark on the head,
lacerations (as if from ﬂogging) on the back, bruises on the shoulders,
and various stains of what is presumed to be blood. Since emerging
in 1354, it has been purported to be the burial garment of Jesus Christ.
It has been preserved since 1578 in the royal chapel of the Cathedral
of San Giovanni Battista in Turin, Italy. [Holy Shroud]

Si  Mu  Wu  fang  ding:  a  late  Shang  bronze  ritual  vessel  that  is  a 
tetrapod  weighing  875 kg  (1925  pounds),  the  largest  metal  casting 
surviving  from  Chinese  antiquity.  Late  Shang  ritual  vessels  reveal 
high  technological  competence  and  large-scale,  labor-intensive  metal
production.  Said  to  have  been  found  in  the  Anyang  royal  cemetery,
the vessel is inscribed with a dedication to an empress and dates prob-
ably from the 12th century bc. It is now in the Historical Museum,
Beijing. [Ssu Mu Wu, Ssu Mu Wu fang-ting]

sica: a curved dagger or scimitar, different from a pugio (which is a straight

dagger).

Sicilian pottery: south Italian pottery using the red-ﬁgured technique of the
late 5th century bc. Production centers included Syracuse, Himera, and
Centuripe.

sickle:  a  knife  for  reaping  corn,  ﬁrst  used  by  Neolithic  man,  made  of
ﬂint and shaped like a banana. These ﬂint blades were mounted in a

Flint sickle

SILK

291

Sickle

Side-notched point

wooden  or  bone  haft,  as  in  the  Natuﬁan  of  Palestine.  Later  sickles
were of bronze, and some of terra cotta were found in Sumer. In the
Bronze Age, a socketed sickle appeared. Since the introduction of iron,
the balanced sickle has become the standard form – a deeply curved
blade bent back from the handle. Its modern form is a curved metal
blade with a short handle ﬁtted on a tang.

sickle element: a component of a composite reaping or harvesting knife,
often made from the medial and distal segments of a backed blade or
from a long backed blade.

sickle gloss: distinctive gloss that occurs on the edge of ﬂint sickle blades,
caused  by  the  wear  of  the  blade  against  the  phytoliths  in  the  cereal
grasses  being  reaped.  The  polish  comes  from  the  abrasive  action  of
silica present in the stems of both wild and cultivated cereals, so the
occurrence of reaping tools with sickle gloss need not by itself imply
agriculture. [sickle sheen, silica gloss]

side blade: a narrow ﬂaked stone, bone, shell, or metal artifact with a
sharp edge on one side inserted in the side of a shaft or projectile point
to provide an extended cutting edge. [sideblade]

side scraper: a retouched ﬂake tool with a thick working edge; a ﬂake
tool that has been sharpened on one edge and left blunt on other edges
to allow grasping, probably used to scrape (dress) animal hides and
for working hard materials. It is called a side scraper (racloir) because
its sharpened edge is the long side. [racloir, scraper, sidescraper]

side-notched  point:  type  of  stone  point  that  is  chipped  on  both  faces 
with  notches  on  both  sides  near  the  base.  They  are  characteristic 
of  the  Northern  Archaic  tradition  in  North  America.  It  is  a  bifaci-
ally  worked,  chipped  stone,  projectile  head  with  shallow  and  wide
notches  worked  into  both  side  edges  near  the  base.  These  notches 
were presumably to assist attachment to the shaft on which the point
was set.

sieve: a container with a perforated bottom through which material is

shaken or poured.

sign: nonﬁgurative representations found engraved or painted in Paleolithic
parietal  art,  including  tectiforms  (hut  shapes)  and  claviforms  (club
shapes) which may be ethnic markers.

silica: silicon dioxide, a hard, unreactive, colorless compound that occurs

as quartz and in sandstone and many other rocks.

silica  gloss:  the  sheen  or  polish  that  occurs  on  ﬂint  when  it  is  used  to

cut grass.

silk:  thread  that  can  be  drawn  off  the  cocoon  spun  by  the  grub  of 
the moth Bombyx mori and used for weaving ﬁne cloth, originating 
in  China  in  the  Neolithic  period.  The  silk  industry  was  established 
by  the  Anyang  period,  c.  1300–1030 bc.  The  Anyang  oracle  bones

292

SILK

include  characters  for  silk,  silk  fabrics,  the  silkworm,  and  the  mul-
berry tree, and traces of silk fabrics are occasionally found preserved.
Silk fabric was used as a writing surface at least as early as the 5th cen-
tury bc. Both manuscripts and paintings on silk have come from Chu
tombs  of  the  5th  century  bc and  later.  Elaborate  methods  of  weav-
ing  were  developed  by  the  Han  dynasty  (206 bc to ad 220),  and 
textiles were exported in large numbers along the “silk route” to the
Roman world and later to Byzantium. The silk route is the collective
name  for  several  overland  and  ocean  routes  for  the  silk  trade  from
the 1st to 8th centuries ad. From Chang’an, capital of the Han dynasty,
the main route went west through the Gansu corridor.

silver: a white, lustrous metal valued for its decorative beauty and elec-
trical conductivity. It is found nearly as early as copper and gold, in
the form of beads, trinkets, and display vessels. The main source of
this metal in antiquity was the lead ore galena, in which silver sulﬁde
occurs as an impurity. After smelting the ore, silver was recovered by
the  process  of  cupellation,  where  the  lead  is  oxidized,  leaving  the 
silver  unaltered.  Silver  is  soft  and  could  be  cold-worked  but  it  was
too soft for most purposes and was often alloyed with other metals,
even in antiquity.

silver-ﬁgured: a technique used to decorate Greek and Etruscan bronze
and gold in which silver ﬁgures were attached to the other metal or
silver foil was placed over the relief decoration.
simple tool: an artifact consisting of a single part.
sinew: thread or cord made from uncured animal tendon.
sinew frayer: a tool similar in shape to a scraper but with serrated edges,
which may have been the forerunner of the saw. Early tribes today use
similar stones to stroke sinews into ﬁbers for sewing.

sinewstone: a rare stone artifact with several incised lines of indentations
on one edge where sinew material was drawn across it to prepare the
material for use as bow string, thread, or string.

single ﬂuting: projectiles or tools which have one ﬂute per face.
single-facet platform: a platform on a biface or core with a single plane

of detachment.

sinker: a weight that sinks (to hold nets or ﬁshing lines under water).
sintering: a process in which the edges of the clay particles soften and
adhere to one another. This process begins at about 350°C and is com-
pleted by 700°C.

sistrum: ancient Egyptian percussion instrument – a rattle consisting of
a wood, metal, or clay frame set loosely with crossbars (often hung
with  jingles)  that  sound  when  the  instrument  was  shaken.  A  handle
was attached to the frame. It was sacred to Hathor and used in the
ceremonial  worship  of  Isis  and  at  funerals.  Open-topped,  U-shaped

sistrums existed by 2500 bc in Sumer. They are still used in Coptic
and Ethiopian churches, in western Africa, among two Native American
tribes, and in Malaysia and Melanesia. [seistron]

situla: a bucket-shaped, Classical vessel of pottery, silver, or sheet bronze,
with  a  swinging  handle  across  the  rim.  Examples  of  bronze  vessels
from the north Italian Iron Age were particularly elaborately decorated;
the style of decoration found on these situlae and other sheet bronze
objects is known as situla art. A situla had a short vertical neck, a shal-
low shoulder, and sloped downward to a narrow base; there were two
handles  and  a  lid.  It  would  be  used  for  drawing  water  from  a  well.
[situlae (pl.)]

situlate: pertaining to vessels with wide mouths, short everted necks, high
shoulders, and straight sides tapering down, from the Iron Age onward.
Six’s  technique:  technique  of  decorating  Athenian  pottery  in  the  6th 
century bc,  as  described  by  J.  Six.  The  pottery’s  black  surface  was
painted in red or white, with the detail cut through, showing the black
surface.

skeuomorph:  an  object  whose  shape  or  decoration  copies  the  form  it
had been when made from another material or by another technique.
For example, a pot might be decorated to make it look similar to a
vessel of basketry, skin, or other material. In some cases, it is an arti-
fact that represents in decorative form a feature which was originally
functional. A decorative bow attached to a shoe is a skeuomorph of
the laces once used to tie it; triangular shapes drawn below handles
on pottery are skeuomorphs of the metal plates by which the handles
on metal prototypes were attached; and the semicircular mark on the
back  of  a  teaspoon  represents  the  broadening  of  the  handle  where 
it was soldered to the bowl when it used to be made in two pieces.
Frequently,  a  skeuomorph  may  yield  important  information  about
extinct  types,  especially  when  organic  materials  like  basketry  are
recorded in this way. [skeuomorphic (adj.)]

skewer pin: long thin bone pins, sometimes with elaborate heads, of the

later Neolithic in the British Isles.

skillet: a frying pan; also, a small metal cooking pot with a long handle,

typically with legs.

skyphos: Greek drinking vessel, usually a deep cup with two horizontal

handles mounted near the rim.

slab  construction:  a  method  of  producing  ceramics  in  which  large  ﬂat
slabs  of  clay  are  made  and  then  joined  and  shaped  into  the  desired
item. [slab building, slab forming, slab method]

slag: partially vitriﬁed waste material created by industrial processes such
as smelting, welding, glassmaking, and pottery making. It is the glassy
material made up of impurities of metals and ores which are removed

294

during  such  processes.  It  is  difﬁcult  to  distinguish  between  slags  of
copper and iron smelting.

slashed cup: a type of miniature cup or accessory vessel of Early Bronze
Age graves in southern England, with a narrow base and mouth and
expanded body with vertical slots in the side.

slate: a ﬁne-grained gray, green, or bluish-purple metamorphic rock (slate,

sandstone, limestone) that is easily split into smooth, ﬂat plates.

slicker: a knife used to rub grease into a hide and to force dirt out of

it. The knife is symmetrical with a handle at each end.

sling: a weapon consisting of two thongs attached to a pouch, and one
of the ﬁrst missile weapons used in warfare. The weapon was whirled
and a thong released, hurling a stone from the pouch with consider-
able velocity. Except in desert areas, such as the Peruvian coast, the
sling itself does not survive but sling bolts or shot of stone, terra cotta,
or lead are present as artifacts. It is rarely found in the same cultural
contexts  as  the  bow  and  arrow.  In  another  type,  the  sling  was
attached to a short staff that was held in both hands; it was used for
heavier  missiles,  especially  in  siege  operations  during  the  European
Middle Ages.

sling shot: a usually spherical stone, clay, or lead projectile for use with

a sling. [slingshot]

slip: a form of surface ﬁnishing applied to pottery, where a mixture of
clay and water is applied before ﬁring to improve the pot’s smooth-
ness  and  to  decrease  porosity  (it  makes  it  more  watertight  by  clog-
ging  the  pores  of  the  earthenware).  Slip  often  contains  the  pigment
which  imparts,  after  ﬁring,  the  ground  color  of  the  vessel.  The  slip,
being clay based, is subject to the same color variation through dif-
ferent  ﬁring  conditions  (oxidizing  or  reducing)  as  the  clay  itself.
Hematite slips, intended to be red, occasionally ﬁre to a shiny black
ﬁnish  in  a  reducing  atmosphere.  Slips  may  or  may  not  be  polished
after  drying,  and  all  sorts  of  decorative  techniques  may  be  used  to
alter this coating. Used as a decoration, slip is applied fairly thickly
to  form  white  or  tinted  patterns;  this  technique  is  called  “slip
painted.”  The  extent  of  slip  is  described  as  either  all-over  or  zone.
The ﬁnish of slip is described as continuous, sparse, smooth, lumpy,
thin, micaceous, or iron-rich. [slurry]

slipped:  a  surface  ﬁnish  in  pottery  obtained  after  ﬁring,  termed  color-
coated when a slip is made darker than the paste of the vessel which
it covers.

slipware:  a  type  of  pottery  decorated  with  slip  before  ﬁring.  The  earl-
iest  English  examples  were  made  at  Wrotham  in  Kent  in  the  early 
17th  century  and  some  of  the  most  decorative  by  Thomas  Toft  in
Staffordshire.

SNAP

295

slow wheel: a ﬂat-topped horizontal turntable that can be rotated to assist
a potter in shaping a ceramic vessel. Slow-turning wheels or tournettes
were used from the 5th or 6th millennia bc in the Near East to help
true up handmade vessels. From the early 4th millennium bc, fast wheels
began to be introduced.

slub: soft lump or unevenness in a yarn, which is either an imperfection

or created by design.

slug knife: type of later Neolithic and Early Bronze Age ﬂint tool found in
the  British  Isles,  particularly  associated  with  burials  in  northeastern
England. Planoconvex knives have a leaf-shaped outline and slightly
elongated form, worked on large thick ﬂakes with retouch around and
sometimes  all  over  the  convex  dorsal  surface  but  a  plain  untouched
ventral surface. [planoconvex knife]

small ﬁnd: a term used to deﬁne artifacts that can be picked up and trans-
ported, as opposed to features. In different areas, however, the term
means different things. In the New World, all artifacts of this sort can
be  called  small  ﬁnds,  while  in  Britain  there  can  be  a  distinction
between “ﬁnds” and “small ﬁnds.” On a site producing few artifacts,
any ﬁnd may be dealt with as a small ﬁnd, while on a site producing
large quantities of material, a small ﬁnd will comprise something spe-
cial, unusual, or unclassiﬁable.

smectite: a group of clay minerals with a three-layer structure (two of

silica, and alumina in between), characterized by expandability.

smelt: to separate metal from ore, usually by heating in a hearth or fur-

nace. [smelting (n.)]

smith’s hoard: any collection of Bronze Age metalwork that appears to
be  the  tools,  etc.  of  a  metalworker,  e.g.,  broken  tools  and  weapons
cut  up  for  recycling,  ingots,  molds,  and  tools  for  working  metal.
[founder’s hoard]

smoking: a process used at the end of the ﬁring of pottery in which mater-
ials that produce a thick smoke are burnt in the kiln or hearth. Smoking
alters the appearance of the pottery, coloring it deep black, and making
the objects less porous.

smoothing: a technique used to ﬁnish the surface of a ceramic piece in
which potters use a spatula of wood or ceramic, a ﬂat tool, or their
bare hand to smooth the surface of the object.

smudged:  pottery  that  has  been  exposed  to  smoke  during  ﬁring  to 

generate black surface features.

snake-thread  glass:  a  series  of  glasses  decorated  with  serpent-like  lines
or colored threads of glass of Roman date from the east, probably in
Syria, and the west, at Cologne and other places.

snap: a purposeful break that was a step in the manufacture of a stone

tool.

296

SNAPPED  BASE

snapped  base:  a  term  used  to  describe  points  that  have  a  part  of  the
base  intentionally  removed  or  fractured  off  as  part  of  the  design  by
the original knapper.

snare: loops of material (vine, ﬁber, leather, etc.) used for catching animals.
snarling  iron:  a  Z-shaped  rod  used  to  create  repoussé  work  on  metal

vessels.

snuffer:  a  small  hollow  metal  cone  on  the  end  of  a  handle,  used  to 
extinguish a candle by smothering the ﬂame; an implement resembling
scissors with an inverted metal cup attached to one blade, used to extin-
guish a candle or trim its wick.

soaking period: the time during which the highest temperature of ﬁring

is sustained.

sociofact: 1. Archaeological data resulting from past human social act-
ivities. 2. An object whose primary function is to express or establish
social  rank,  rather  than  to  serve  practical  or  ideological  needs.  An 
example is an ax that is used as a symbol of chiefdom rather than as
a weapon.

sociofunction:  use  of  an  object  for  social  purposes,  to  express  social 
status  or  organization,  such  as  the  wearing  of  a  certain  garment  to
convey high social status.

sociotechnic: a category of material culture in which items are inferred

to have served social roles, such as identity marking.

socket:  a  hole  made  in  an  object  to  take  a  haft.  It  is  usually  closed  at
one end, in contrast to a shaft hole which is open at both ends. The
term also refers to a bronze or iron weapon or tool cast so that it was
hollow and open at the butt end to allow a haft to be inserted. [sock-
eted implement]

socketed ax: a type of tool in which the body of the tool is hollow so
that it can receive a shaped projection at the end of the haft in order
to secure the haft to the metal axhead. They were made in molds in
the late European Bronze Age. [socketed axe, socketed axhead]

socketed spearhead: a type of spearhead in which an elongated hollow
was cast into the base of the blade to receive the shaped end of the
wooden  spear  shaft,  of  the  middle  and  later  stages  of  the  European
Bronze Age.

soda-lime glass: glass produced using soda derived by burning seaweed

and kelp.

soft hammer technique: use of a hammer that is softer than the material
being hammered or struck. The hammer would be made of antler, bone,
wood, or other soft material and used to remove ﬂat ﬂakes from ﬂint.
These ﬂakes have a characteristic appearance – long, thin, and with a
diffuse bulb of percussion. [bar hammer technique, cylinder hammer
technique, soft-hammer percussion]

SPATULATE

297

soft  paste:  artiﬁcial  porcelain,  made  in  Europe  before  the  discovery  of
kaolin, one of the ingredients necessary for true, or hard-paste, porce-
lain. It was manufactured from white clays, mixed with ground glass
to give it translucency. It was ﬁrst produced at the Medici factory in
Florence between 1575 and 1587 and then in France in the early 18th
century. The Sèvres factory made only soft-paste porcelain for its ﬁrst
30 years and it was the main type of porcelain produced in England
in the 18th century.

solar boat: in Egyptian mythology, a high-prowed boat in which the sun
god was believed to navigate the heavens. Some Pyramid Texts refer to
the deceased pharaoh going to join the gods in such a boat. There were
two different types: day/mandet, night/mesektet. [solar bark, sun boat]
soldering: a method, used since the Bronze Age, of joining pieces of metal
by melting an alloy of tin and lead into the joint to fuse the two edges
together.  The  application  of  a  ﬂux  to  the  surfaces  to  be  soldered  is
generally  required.  A  soldered  joint  will  not  withstand  much  stress.
[to solder (v.)]

Somme sequence: the valley in France that was one of the ﬁrst places where
the great antiquity of man was recognized, and which includes the type
site of the Acheulian (St. Acheul) and the Abbevillean (Abbeville).

South Italian pottery: pottery type made by the Greek colonies of southern
Italy and Sicily, mainly from the late 5th century bc, with many centers
of production.

spacer  plate:  a  specialized  ﬂat  bead  with  several  parallel  perforations
intended to hold apart, in regular order, the threads of a multiple-strand
necklace. Sometimes, as in the amber multiperforated spacer plates of
the central European and British Bronze Age and the Mycenaeans, the
perforations  themselves  are  used  decoratively.  They  were  also  made
of jet or faience. Similar examples found in distant regions are often
taken as indicators of long-range trade. [spacer-plate]

spade:  a  tool  with  a  sharp-edged,  rectangular,  metal  blade  and  a  long

handle, used for digging.

spall: a small, usually long and thin, ﬂint piece removed from a burin.
Spanish  Levant  art:  a  series  of  rock  shelters  in  the  arid  region  of  the
Spanish Levant (Mediterranean Spain) with paintings in red and black
from the Mesolithic. The scenes were quite unlike Paleolithic art and
the depictions offer information about the character of everyday life.
spatula: a tool, usually of bone, lime, wood, ebony, turtleshell, etc., con-
sisting of a broad but thin blade. It served many general purposes –
spreading, mixing, scooping, lifting – including burnishing pottery, work-
ing pelts, spooning ﬂour, etc.

spatulate: a ﬂared celt, usually 20–25 cm (8–10 inches) long with a smooth,

slender handle, used mainly like a chisel or knife. [spud]

SPEAR

spear: a pole weapon with a sharp point, either thrown or thrust at an
enemy or prey, one of the earliest weapons created by people and dat-
ing back to Paleolithic times. They were originally a sharpened stick
and some had heads made of stone, shaped and ﬁxed to the shaft by
thongs and possibly resins. In the Bronze Age, the heads were made
of bronze and had a tang for riveting the head to the shaft. Later, the
tang  was  replaced  by  a  socket  into  which  the  shaft  ﬁtted.  The  Iron
Age spears retained this feature and were sometimes decorated with
La Tène designs.

spear  thrower:  a  device  that  increases  the  power  with  which  a  spear 
can be hurled; a long stick with a hooked end which holds the butt
of  a  spear.  The  implement  usually  has  ﬁnger  grips  at  one  end.  The
device  thus  becomes  an  artiﬁcial  extension  of  the  thrower’s  arm, 
giving  him  increased  leverage  and  range  and  allowing  the  thrower 
to hurl a spear accurately a much greater distance than he could unaided.
Spear  throwers  were  used  in  Europe  during  the  Paleolithic  and
throughout  the  New  World  in  pre-Columbian  times,  where  they 
were  known  as  atlatls.  Spear  throwers  made  of  reindeer  antler  are 
characteristic  of  the  Magdalenian  period  in  Europe.  Similar  devices
were used in the Arctic, and in Australia, where they are often called
woomeras. [atl-atl, atlatl, spear-thrower, spearthrower, throwing stick,
woomera]

spearhead:  bifacially  ﬂaked  points,  or  a  thrusting  blade  mounted  on  a
long shaft (spear) as a weapon for war or hunting. Early examples in
ﬂint were usually leaf-shaped, and hafted simply in a cleft in the spear
shaft. In the Early Bronze Age, bronze dagger blades were made and
ferrules added. The socketed spearhead came when these were cast in
one piece with the blade.

spearpoint: a larger arrowhead used to hunt larger game such as deer,
antelope, elk, buffalo, etc. It is the tip of a projectile, used for throw-
ing, thrusting, or stabbing. [spear point]

spectrographic analysis: method for quantitative analysis of small samples
of various compounds which has high accuracy. It involves passing the
light refracted from a sample through a prism or diffraction grating
that spreads out the wavelengths of trace elements into a spectrum. This
enables the identiﬁcation of different trace elements and depends on
the  fact  that  light  emitted  by  any  element  on  volatilization  shows  a
characteristic  pattern  when  split  by  a  prism  into  its  spectrum.  The 
elements present can be measured by the intensity of the lines in com-
parison with control spectra of known composition produced under
the  same  conditions.  A  small  sample  can  be  used,  less  than  10 mg,
making the method particularly suitable for archaeological material.
The method has been used especially for metal analysis, giving useful

information on technology and sources of the raw materials, and also
for glass, faience, pottery, and obsidian.

spherical: shaped like a sphere.
sphinx: a mythical beast portrayed with the crouched body of a lion and
the head or face of a man. It is especially known from Egyptian art
as a symbol of royal power and only the pharaoh was depicted in this
form. Originally considered by the Egyptians to represent the guardian
of the Gates of Sunset, the statues were usually erected to guard tombs
or temples from intruders. The largest and most famous of the sphinxes
is that of Giza, carved from a knoll left by the quarrying of stone for
the Great Pyramid. Its features are those of the pharaoh Chephren (Khafre)
of the 4th dynasty, reigning in c. 26th century bc; it is 73 m long and
20 m high (80 × 22 yards). Human-headed lions, usually female, were
also portrayed by the Hittites and Greeks; the Romans adopted them
and placed them in the pronaos of their temples. Representations of
ram-headed  lions  are  called  crio-sphinxes  and  were  associated  with
the god Amon (Amen); they are of the New Kingdom and are found
along the roads between the Temple of Luxor and Karnak.

sphyrelaton:  1.  A  type  of  bronze  hammered  statue,  made  by  hammer-
ing  bronze  plates  over  a  core,  which  were  secured  by  nails.  It  is  an
early form of art manufacture in metal, the precursor to the lost wax
(cire  perdue)  technique.  The  temple  of  Apollo  on  Crete  (8th  cen-
tury bc) has three statues of this type. The technique was also used
to produce colossal statues. 2. Repoussé work in Minoan or Etruscan
art. [sphyrelata (pl.)]

spiculum: barbed head of an iron arrow or lance. [specula (pl.)]
spigot: a form of stopper used to regulate the ﬂow of liquid, often used

in a barrel.

spindle  whorl:  a  circular  object  with  a  central  perforation  intended  to
act as a ﬂy wheel on a spindle, giving momentum to its rotation – an
artifact  providing  evidence  of  the  spinning  of  thread.  It  maintained
the momentum of the spindle rotated by the spinner while he/she teased
more ﬁbers out of a ﬂeece. They may be of stone, bone, or pottery,
varying from ﬂat disks to spherical or pyriform, and ranging from 2.5
to 10 cm (1–4 inches) in diameter.

spinning: extrusion of liquid ﬁber-forming material, followed by hard-
ening to form ﬁlaments; also, this is a technical process by which ﬁbers
are twisted together to make continuous threads. The wool was ﬁxed
as a mass on the distaff. A thread was drawn out by one hand and
ﬁxed on the spindle. Attached to this last was a stone spindle whorl.
As  the  spindle  was  spun  around,  the  whorl  gave  momentum  on  the
ﬂywheel principle. The thread from the distaff was twisted and then
wound on to the spindle. The threads, or cloth woven from them, are

300

SPINNING

rarely found in archaeological contexts, unless preserved by desicca-
tion, waterlogging, or metal corrosion products. Proof of spinning comes
more commonly from the discovery of a spindle whorl, loom weight,
or comb. Spinning was engaged in during Neolithic times.

spiral: a widely popular artistic motif, consisting of a curve of constantly
increasing  diameter;  any  motif  which  is  coiled  or  curling.  A  double
spiral is one in which two spirals are conjoined at the center. A run-
ning spiral is a series of regularly interconnected spirals. [spira]

spiral nail: a nail that tends to turn into the wood like a screw as it is
driven home, used in ﬂooring to assure a tight and squeak-proof joining.
spirit path: rows of stone sculptures facing up the path to Chinese mounded
tombs, created from the Han dynasty to guard or honor the deceased.
They are often sculptures of people or animals, from close to life-size
to double life-size.

spit:  a  device  to  hold  and  rotate  food  against  a  heat  source  during 

cooking.

spit-shaped  currency  bar:  wrought  iron  bars  found  in  the  Middle  and

Late Iron Age of central and midland parts of England.

split pin: a metal pin with two arms which is passed through a hole and

held in place by the springing apart of the arms.

spokeshave: a stone tool with a semicircular concavity used for smooth-
ing spears or arrowshafts; a drawknife or small transverse plane with
end handles for planing convex or concave surfaces.

sponge ﬁnger: a type of stone object of later Neolithic and Early Bronze
Age graves in northern and western Europe, often associated with Beaker
pots, elongated with a D-shaped cross-section and rounded ends.

spoon: an implement consisting of a small, shallow oval or round bowl

on a long handle, used for eating, stirring, and serving food.

spout: a neck-like appendage that restricts a secondary oriﬁce occurring
to one side of a vessel’s vertical axis, and typically on the vessel’s upper
body or shoulder.

spout and bridge pot: a distinctive closed vessel with two spouts connected
by a strap handle, popular in southern coastal Peruvian cultures with
antecedents  in  the  Initial  Period  ceramics  of  the  Hacha  complex.
Typically  it  is  a  closed  kettle-shaped  vessel,  but  its  deﬁning  charac-
teristic is a pair of vertical tubular spouts joined to each other by a
strip or bridge. Sometimes, however, one spout terminates as a whistle
or as a modeled life ﬁgure. It was particularly popular with the Nasca
and Chimu but has been found in many other New World contexts
(e.g., Paracas). [spout-and-bridge vessel]

spouted strainer: a type of bowl, often biconical, with a projecting tubular

spout and internal strainer.

spud: a tool, possibly for cleaning mud from parts of a plow.

spur: kiln furniture consisting of triangular supports placed to prevent
glazed ware from sticking to shelves of the kiln during ﬁring. [cock-
spur, stilt, trivet]

square-mouthed pot: a vessel type in which the circular mouth was pinched
into  a  squarish  form  while  the  clay  was  still  soft,  characteristic  of 
the Middle Neolithic of northern Italy, especially at Arene Candide.
It is thought to show inﬂuence from the Danubian culture of central
Europe. There are scattered examples from as far as Crete, Sicily, and
Spain. [bocca quadrata, square-mouthed pottery]

square-shank  concrete  nail:  a  nail  used  to  fasten  furring  strips  and 

brackets to concrete walls and ﬂoors.

St. Albans point: bifacially worked chipped stone projectile points with
corner  notches,  made  by  the  Early  Archaic  stage  in  eastern  parts  of
North America c. 7500 bc.

St. Remy ware:  ﬁne  pottery,  often  having  relief  decoration,  in  a  white
fabric with a green or yellow (lead) glaze, made at St-Remy-en-Rollat,
near Vichy, c. 1st century ad.

stadial:  a  period  during  a  glaciation  when  the  temperature  was  at  its
lowest and the ice sheets and glaciers were most extensive. They are
separated by warmer interstadial periods. These cold episodes are of
relatively short duration.

stage: a level of cultural development characterized by a technology and
its associated social and ideological features; a large-scale archaeological
unit  consisting  of  a  well-deﬁned  level  of  development  attained  by  a
particular culture area. The adoption of agriculture, for instance, had
profound cultural and social consequences, raising people to a higher
stage.  This  technological  subdivision  of  prehistoric  time  has  little
chronological meaning beyond the regional (as it may be continental or
global),  an  example  being  the  Stone  Age,  though  stages  are  integral
parts of the chronological sequencing of culture history.

stain:  a  prepared,  fritted  compound  of  coloring  oxides,  alumina,  and 
a  ﬂux  used  as  a  glaze  colorant  or  for  overglaze  and  underglaze 
decoration.

stained  glass:  colored  glass  used  for  making  decorative  windows  and 
other objects through which light passes, created since early Christian
times. It was not an important art until about the 12th century.

Stamford  ware:  an  Anglo-Saxon  pottery  industry  centered  around
Stamford in Lincolnshire, England, that produced ﬁne glazed ceramics
in  the  9th  to  13th  centuries.  The  buff  wares  included  characteristic
spouted  pitchers  and  jugs  which  were  much  in  demand  in  England
and were sometimes traded abroad.

stamnos: a type of Classical Greek vase, similar in size to the amphora,
and  likewise  used  typically  for  the  storage  of  wine.  The  stamnos, 

302

STAMNOS

however,  is  more  squat  in  form,  with  two  horizontal  handles  and  a
round mouth. The shape was popular with Athenian red-ﬁgure vase
painters in the period from about 525 to 400 bc and in Etruria in the
4th century bc.

stamp: a tool that produces a mark on an object through the applica-

tion of percussive force through the stamp.

stamp seal: a small, hard block that has a ﬂat surface engraved with a
design that can be transferred to soft clay or wax as a mark of own-
ership or authenticity. Stamp seals appear in Mesopotamia from the
Halaﬁan  period  in  the  ﬁfth  millennium  bc,  when  they  were  used  to
impress ownership marks on lumps of clay which were then attached
to  goods.  In  the  Bronze  Age,  it  was  differently  shaped  for  different
cultures:  square  in  the  Indus,  round  in  the  Persian  Gulf  (Barbar), 
and compartmented in central Asia (Bactrian). Stamp seals preceded
cylinders and developed over a period of about 1500 years until largely
replaced  by  the  cylinder  in  the  3rd  millennium  bc.  Seals  came  into 
use before the invention of writing for the securing of property and
the method was either to shape clay over the stopper or lid or to make
a  fastening  with  cord  and  place  clay  around  the  knot  and  then
impress it with the seal. The sealing of written documents, mainly clay
tablets and papyrus scrolls, became regularly established in the latter
part of the 3rd millennium bc.

stamped  decoration:  a  technique  of  ornamentation  on  the  soft  clay  of 
a pot by repeatedly impressing a simple design previously carved on
a bone or wooden tool. Figured stamps were also used. It also refers
to using an implement or paddle to impress designs on a ceramic sur-
face;  a  stamp,  seal,  or  die  especially  made  for  the  purpose  is  used 
to  displace  pottery  fabric  near  the  surface  of  a  plastic  or  nearly
leather-hard  vessel  and  create  a  pattern  or  design.  [stamped,  stamp-
ing (adj.)]

stamping:  a  kind  of  impression  where  a  stamp,  seal,  or  die  especially
made for the purpose is used to displace pottery fabric near the surface
of a plastic or nearly leather-hard vessel and create a pattern or design.
stance: the position that orients a vessel the way it would typically be

when resting on a surface, usually with the rim horizontal.

stance  line:  line  representing  the  horizontal  plane  in  the  illustration  of

pottery.

staple: a fastener made in many forms to hold wire fencing, bell wire,

electric cable, screening, etc.

stater: a Greek coin of electrum and silver, a standard unit which was

equivalent to the Near East shekel and the silver didrachm.

statue: a three-dimensional representation.
statue  menhir:  a  standing  stone  carved  to  represent  the  human  form, 
sometimes  with  details  of  clothing  or  weapons.  Most  examples  in 

STEPPED  ADZE

Europe seem to belong to the Late Neolithic/Copper Age period and
they are concentrated in southern and western France, Iberia, Liguria,
Corsica,  Sardinia,  and  Italy  (Apulia,  northwest  Tuscany,  and  near 
the  Swiss  and  Austrian  borders).  Northern  Italy  also  has  a  more 
recent group of statue menhirs set up by Ligurian peoples during the
Iron Age. Bronze Age examples are also known. Most statue menhirs
are of men. [statue-menhir, stela menhir]

stave  bow:  a  simple  bow  made  from  a  single  piece  of  wood,  such 

as yew.

steatite: a soft magnesian mineral or white to green massive rock com-
posed mainly of talc. The softness of the stone made it very popular
for the carving of artifacts: ﬁgurines, vessels, jewelry, decorative stone
works,  and  stamp  seals.  Its  resistance  to  high  temperatures  made  it
particularly suitable for mold making for metal casting. In the Indus
civilization seals of this material were whitened by heating with lime,
a process called “glazing.” [soapstone]

steep bevel:  a  bevel  of  a  blade  edge  or  stem  edge  that  was  ﬂaked  at  a

steep angle (> 40 degrees) to the plane of the face.

steepness of retouch: angle between the ﬂat plane of a ﬂake and a retouched

surface. Very steep retouch is close to 90 degrees.

stela:  an  upright,  freestanding  stone  monument,  often  inscribed  or
carved  in  relief,  and  sometimes  painted.  These  pillars  or  tablets  of 
stone  were  often  used  to  mark  a  grave  or  erected  as  a  monument.
Inscriptions  may  commemorate  a  victory  or  a  major  event,  or  pro-
claim a formal decree. Stelae are frequently encountered in Maya and
Olmec sites of Mesoamerica (often carved with calendrical and hiero-
glyphic inscriptions), in the Buddhist civilizations of Asia, and in early
Greece. The earliest funerary stelae are from a cemetery of 1st- and
2nd-dynasty  kings  at  Abydos,  and  are  located  in  publicly  accessible
superstructures of the tombs. Commemorative stelae were erected in
temples.  Votive  stelae  recorded  an  individual’s  veneration  of  a  par-
ticular deity(ies). [stele; stelae (pl.)]

stem: extension of the base of a projectile point or knife that was designed

for hafting or gripping. Stems can occur in various shapes.

stemmed point: a projectile or blade that has a stem that was designed

for hafting or holding. [notchless point, shouldered point]

step fracture: a vertical upstep where the distal end of a blade or ﬂake
broke  from  the  parent  material.  Such  a  ﬂake  scar  is  indicative  of  a
well-executed form of percussion ﬂaking.

step termination: a blunt fracture at the distal end of a lithic ﬂake that

appears stairlike in cross-section. [step fracture; stepped (adj.)]

stepped adze: polished stone adze of the Chinese Neolithic, roughly rect-
angular in shape, and ﬂat on one side with a step on the other. It is
also found in Southeast Asia.

STIRRUP

stirrup: each of a pair of devices attached at either side of a horse’s saddle,

in the form of a loop with a ﬂat base to support the rider’s foot.

stirrup jar: ceramic jar of medium size with a ﬂat knob connected to the
shoulder  by  two  handles,  in  place  of  the  central  mouth.  A  separate
spout was added elsewhere on the shoulder. It was much used by the
Mycenaeans and in Minoan Crete for storing or transporting perfume,
oil, etc. [false-necked amphora]

stirrup spout: semicircular tub set vertically, like a croquet hoop, on top
of a closed vessel. The lower ends open into the body of the pot, and
a single vertical spout rises from the apex of the curve. From the side,
it  looked  like  a  stirrup.  It  was  common  in  many  Peruvian  cultures
(Moche,  Chimu,  Chavín,  Cupisnique,  Nazca)  and  in  other  parts  of
the New World, with precursors in the Initial Period. In Chavín pot-
tery, for example, the earliest stirrup spouts were relatively small, very
thick, and heavy, and the spout had a thick ﬂange. As time went on,
the stirrups became lighter and the spouts longer; the ﬂange was reduced
and  ﬁnally  disappeared.  The  necks  of  the  ﬂasks  underwent  similar
changes. The Cupisnique stirrup-spouted vessels, some of which were
modeled  in  the  form  of  human  beings,  animals,  or  fruits,  were  the
beginning of a north-coast tradition of naturalistic modeling. [stirrup-
spout vessel]

Stone  Age:  the  oldest  and  longest  division  of  the  Three  Age  System, 
preceding the Bronze Age and Iron Age. It is the oldest known period
of  human  culture  –  characterized  by  the  use  of  stone  tools.  This 
prehistoric  age  embraces  the  Paleolithic  (Old),  Mesolithic  (Middle),
and  Neolithic  (New).  These  three  separate  periods  are  based  on  the
degree  of  sophistication  in  the  fashioning  and  use  of  tools.  Metals 
were unknown, but tools and weapons were also made of wood, bone,
and antler. The dates for the Stone Age vary considerably from one
region  to  another,  and  some  communities  were  still  living  a  Stone 
Age life until very recent times. In sub-Saharan Africa, the Stone Age
is  equivalent  to  the  term  Paleolithic,  and  spans  from  c.  2.5  million
years ago until the 19th century ad.

stone tool: a tool made of stone, either ground stone or chipped stone;

a lithic artifact.

stoneware: distinctive pottery that has been ﬁred at a high temperature
(about 1200°C) until glasslike and impervious to liquid. It is usually
opaque, and because it is nonporous, it does not require a glaze. When
a  glaze  is  used,  it  is  decorative  only.  Stoneware  originated  in  China
as early as 1400 bc (Shang dynasty). The technique made possible the
production of durable tablewares.

stopper: a plug for sealing a hole, especially in the neck of a bottle.
stop-ridge: transverse ridges added to the faces of a ﬂat ax mounted in a
right-angled cleft haft to transfer some of the impact from the base of

STROKE-ORNAMENTED  WARE

305

the cleft to the tips. Axes with stop-ridges form an intermediate step
in development between the ﬂanged ax and the palstave. The term also
refers to a ridge on a celt or pipe which prevents one part from slipping
too far over another. [stop ridge]

storage jar: large jars used for storing grain or other materials.
strangulated blade scraper: a long blade tool with a retouched notch on

one or both sides, of the Aurignacian.

strap end: a sometimes decorated metal reinforcement for the end of a

strap.

strap handle: for ceramics, a handle made from a strip of clay and attached

to the body of the pot at two points before ﬁring.

stray ﬁnd: an object of some kind – pottery, metalwork, a coin, etc. –
which  has  not  been  found  in  an  archaeological  context.  Stray  ﬁnds
are  useful  if  the  total  distribution  of  a  particular  type  of  object  is
required, but the absence of associated material or structures makes
their interpretation difﬁcult.

stress: an applied force, measured per unit area; in pottery, it includes

tensile, compression, transverse, and impact stresses.

stria:  a  linear  mark,  ridge,  or  groove,  especially  one  of  a  number  of 

similar parallel features. [striae (pl.)]

striation: microscopic scratches, grooves, or channels on stone tools, which

often reveal the direction of force and the nature of tool use.

strigil: a narrow curved scraper, made of horn or metal (bronze, silver),
used by Roman and Greek bathers for the cleansing of the skin. A strigil
was used to remove olive oil applied after bathing or exercising. Romans
used them particularly in the hot room (caldarium) and the task was
often performed by slaves. On Athenian pottery, strigils are shown in
the hands of athletes. The term comes from the Latin strigilis.

strike-a-light: a type of rod- or bar-shaped ﬂint tool with a slightly pointed
end, used with stone such as iron pyrites for making sparks to start a ﬁre.
striking  platform:  the  area  on  a  stone  core  that  is  struck  to  remove  a
ﬂake or blade in toolmaking. Part of the original platform is removed
with  the  detached  ﬂake.  The  platform  itself  is  prepared  by  the
removal of one or more ﬂakes, and in the latter case is described as
a faceted striking platform. [platform]

string mark: marks on the base of a vessel caused by the potter detach-

ing the pot from the wheel with a wire or string.

Stroke-Ornamented ware: pottery with zigzag patterns made by a series
of distinct jabs rather than continuous lines. The culture of this name
was  an  Early/Middle  Neolithic  culture  of  west  central  Europe,  that
developed directly out of the Linear Pottery culture, c. 4000–3800 bc.
Bohemia,  southwest  Poland,  Bavaria,  and  central  Germany  were  its
locale.  The  culture  had  longhouses  which  were  slightly  trapezoidal.

STROP

Stunner

strop: a leather strap for sharpening a razor.
structured  deposition:  material  entering  the  archaeological  record

through speciﬁc activities or behavior patterns, and not randomly.

studded: pertaining to pottery decorated by adding pellets of clay to its

surface. [studded pottery]

stunner: an arrowhead with a rounded tip rather than a point, named
for the speculation that it was shot with a bow and arrow to merely
stun or daze an animal rather than to penetrate or kill. [bunt]

stupa:  a  Buddhist  monument  consisting  of  a  circular  or  hemispherical
mound with a domelike casing of stone, often tiled, and intended to
contain  relics  of  the  Buddha  or  a  Buddhist  saint.  Existing  in  China,
Japan,  Korea,  India,  Java,  and  Southeast  Asia,  stupas  are  often  the
focus of a monastery. They are surrounded by a decorative railing show-
ing the Buddha’s life and mythological ﬁgures. The Mauryan emperor
Asoka is said to have built 84,000 stupas, including the most famous
at Sanchi (Madhya Pradesh, c. 2nd century bc). Hindus of the Jainist
sect built stupas commemorating saints.

S-twist: cordage ply twisted to the maker’s right.
style: any distinctive and therefore recognizable way in which an act is
performed and made. In archaeology, stylistic areas are area units rep-
resenting shared ways of producing and decorating artifacts.

stylistic analysis: artifact analysis focused on form and function as well as
the decorative styles used by the makers, used very often for ceramics.
stylistic  attribute:  well-deﬁned  local  variations  in  artifacts  that  may
reﬂect territorial boundaries; characteristics/attributes of an artifact that
relate  to  its  surface  appearance,  such  as  color,  decoration,  and  tex-
ture – leading to stylistic classiﬁcations. [stylistic boundary marker]
stylistic  seriation:  organization  of  artifacts  or  other  data  by  sequence
according to changes over time in their stylistic attributes; a relative
age determination technique.

stylistic type: an artifact type based on stylistic distinctions.
stylus: pointed writing instrument made from a variety of materials: reed
stem, bone, ivory, or metal (iron, bronze, silver). The sharpened imple-
ment is shaped like a pen with a wedge-shaped tip and one end ﬂattened
like a spatula; the latter served either to spread the wax on a writing
tablet or to erase by smoothing. The stylus was used in ancient times
as a tool for writing on parchment or papyrus. The early Greeks incised
letters on wax-covered boxwood tablets using a stylus. A stylus was
also  used  for  impressing  cuneiform  writing  into  wet  clay  tablets,
which were then baked. [stilus; styli, styluses (pl.)]

subassemblage: a grouping or association of artifacts, based on form and
functional criteria. A subassemblage is assumed to represent a single
occupational group within a prehistoric community. [sub-assemblage]

Sub-Atlantic: last of the ﬁve postglacial climate and vegetation periods
of northern Europe, beginning c. 1500 bc (according to pollen ana-
lysis,  though  radiocarbon  dating  gives  a  date  of  c.  225 bc).  It  is  a 
division  of  Holocene  chronology  (10,000  years  ago  to  the  present).
The  Sub-Atlantic  interval  followed  the  Sub-Boreal  climatic  interval 
and continues today. It is a subdivision of the Flandrian, which was
thought to be wet and cold, a trend started in the preceding Sub-Boreal
period. At the beginning of the period there was a dominance of beech
forests  and  the  fauna  was  essentially  modern.  During  the  Iron  Age,
pollen analysis shows evidence of intensiﬁed forest clearance for mixed
farming. Sea levels have been generally regressive during this time inter-
val, though North America is an exception.

Sub-Boreal: one of the ﬁve postglacial climate and vegetation periods of
northern Europe, occurring c. 3000–1500 bc or, according to some,
to ad 1,  based  on  pollen  analysis.  The  Sub-Boreal,  dated  by  radio-
carbon methods, began c. 5100 years ago and ended about 2200 years
ago. It is a division of Holocene chronology (10,000 years ago to the
present).  The  Sub-Boreal  climatic  interval  followed  the  Atlantic  and
preceded the Sub-Atlantic climatic interval. It was characterized by a
cooler and moister climate than that of the preceding Atlantic period.
It is a subdivision of the Flandrian, starting with the elm decline. The
frequencies of tree pollen fall and herbaceous pollen rises, represent-
ing man’s invasion of the forest in the Neolithic and Bronze Age. It is
correlated  with  pollen  zone  VIII.  The  Sub-Boreal  forests  were  dom-
inated by oak and ash and show the ﬁrst evidence of extensive burning
and  clearance  by  humans.  Domesticated  animals  and  natural  fauna
were abundant.

Submycenaean: a phase between the late Helladic and the Protogeometric
periods on mainland Greece, known from its pottery found in cemet-
eries in Attica and from sites in central Greece and the Peloponnese.
It  is  dated  c.  1050–1020 bc.  Pottery  was  the  ﬁrst  art  to  recover  its
standards after the Dorian invasion and the overthrow of Mycenae.
Athens  escaped  these  disasters  and  in  the  ensuing  dark  age  became
the main source of ceramic ideas. For a short time Mycenaean motifs
survived on new shapes – the Submycenaean ware. It gave way to the
Protogeometric  (c.  1020–900 bc)  style  by  converting  the  decaying
Mycenaean ornament into regular geometric patterns.

subtractive technology: any manufacturing process in which artifacts take
form  as  material  is  removed  from  the  original  mass.  Flint  knapping
is a subtractive technology.

Sue ware: bluish-gray, high-ﬁred pottery of the Kofun, Nara, and Heian
periods in Japan (5th to 14th centuries ad), derived from Kaya pot-
tery of the Old Silla period in Korea. A large number of vessels were

308

SUE  WARE

made  on  a  mechanical  wheel,  and  ﬁred  in  a  kiln  at  about  1100°C;
the  blue-gray  color  resulted  from  the  oxygen-reduced  atmosphere 
in the kiln towards the end of the ﬁring process. By the 6th century,
Sue  pottery  was  mass  produced  at  many  centers,  with  the  emphasis
on specialized ceremonial vessels, then on utilitarian pots and dishes 
for the elite, and ﬁnally on storage and cooking pots for the general
population. When it was ﬁrst imported from Korea, it was deposited
in mounded tombs of the Kofun period.

sumatralith:  unifacially  worked  discoid  stone  tool,  often  made  from 
a  thin  slice  of  the  cortex  of  a  large  pebble.  It  is  found  in  Southeast
Asia and northern Sumatra, and is characteristic of some Hoabinhian
assemblages.

sun disk: decorative symbol for the sun; an ancient Near Eastern symbol
consisting  of  a  disk  with  conventionalized  wings  emblematic  of  the
sun god (as Ra in Egypt). It was also used frequently throughout the
European Bronze Age. [sun disc]

sunbaked:  of  pottery,  baked  or  hardened  by  exposure  to  sunlight  and

not ﬁred. [unﬁred]

superimposition: application of glass on top of other glass surfaces, includ-

ing methods such as threading, banding, quilting, and casing.

superposition: principle that artifacts found at a lower level of a site pre-
date those at a higher level; the order in which sedimentary layers are
deposited, the highest being the youngest.

sur  enclume:  bipolar  or  bidirectional  backing  of  a  stone  tool;  backing

produced by force from two directions.

surface ﬁnd: an artifact found on the surface of the ground.
surface  ﬁnish:  in  the  study  of  ceramic  artifacts,  the  mainly  decorative

outer elements of a vessel.

surface survey: a method of data collection in which archaeological ﬁnds
are gathered from the ground surface of sites and then evaluated. Also,
the study of the distribution of surviving features, and the recording
and possible collecting of artifacts from the surface. Surface surveys
help to establish the types of activity on the site, locate major struc-
tures, and gather information on the most densely occupied areas of
the site that could be most productive for total or sample excavation.
There  are  two  basic  kinds  of  surface  survey:  unsystematic  and  sys-
tematic.  The  former  involves  ﬁeldwalking,  i.e.,  scanning  the  ground
along  one’s  path  and  recording  the  location  of  artifacts  and  surface
features.  A  systematic  survey  is  less  subjective  and  involves  a  grid 
system  that  is  walked  systematically,  thus  making  the  recording  of 
ﬁnds  more  accurate.  A  surface  survey  usually  includes  the  mapping
of features. [site surface survey]

surface treatment: any modiﬁcation made to the surface of pottery for
either technological or functional purposes. The terms used are: wiped,

SWORD

smoothed,  burnished,  knife-trimmed,  ﬁngered,  throwing  marks,  tin
glazed, salt glazed, copper-stained glaze, mica slipped/dusted, slipped
white, wheelmade, or molded.

Surrey  white  ware:  a  style  of  medieval  pottery  made  in  Surrey  from 
c. 1300 ad, with an off-white or buff-colored fabric, possibly with a
patchy green glaze, though later on thick green and yellow glazes were
used. The main forms were cooking pots, cauldrons, skillets, pipkins,
jugs, jars, and pitchers.

Suswa: an early pastoral Neolithic pottery tradition found only in high-

land Kenya, dating to 4860 bp at Enkapune ya Muto. [Salasun]

swan’s  neck  pin:  style  of  bronze  or  iron  pin  of  the  1st  millennium 
bc British  Isles,  with  three  bends  in  the  upper  part  to  make  an 
S-shaped head.

Swiderian point: type of stone point made on a blade and having a stemmed
base ﬂaked on both sides. It is characteristic of the Swiderian industry
of Poland (Upper Paleolithic, c. 11,000–9000 bp).

Swieciechow ﬂint: a variety of ﬂint from the Holy Cross Mountains of
central Poland. It is dark gray to black with ﬂecks of white or light
gray. It was exploited primarily by communities of the Funnel Beaker
culture and distributed over a broad area in the Bug, Vistula, and Oder
drainage  basins.  Commonly  found  in  the  form  of  very  large  blades
(up to 30 cm or 1 foot long) and axes.

sword:  a  weapon  evolved  from  daggers  in  the  Bronze  Age,  becoming
longer  and  made  with  different  kinds  of  grips.  The  sword  was  used
for slashing and thrusting and has a broader blade than a rapier, plus
a ﬂanged hilt. Single-edged swords are rare and they are more often
called sabers or falchions. Sword classiﬁcations are based on the form

SWORD

of the hilt and the shoulder. Swords probably developed in Hungary
and then spread to the Aegean, where they are found in shaft graves
at Mycenae c. 1650 bc, and the rest of Europe and western Asia. From
then  until  the  development  of  ﬁrearms  it  remained  one  of  the  main
weapons of war.

symbol: one item used to stand for or represent another – as in the case

of a ﬂag, which symbolizes a nation.

Symbolkeramik:  pottery  ware  of  the  Spanish  Copper/Early  Bronze 
Age  of  Almeria,  as  at  Los  Millares,  decorated  with  stylized  designs, 
especially  oculi  (rayed  sun)  motifs.  The  designs  are  thought  to  hold
symbolic meanings.

symmetry:  a  property  of  design  based  on  the  spatial  position  of  the 
geometric ﬁgure(s) constituting the fundamental part of the design, and
on the movement of the ﬁgure(s) across a line or around a point axis.
symmetry  analysis:  a  mathematical  analytical  approach  to  the  decora-
tive style of symmetry. Patterns are divided into two distinct groups
or symmetry classes: 17 classes for those patterns that repeat motifs
horizontally,  and  46  classes  for  those  that  repeat  them  horizontally
and vertically. Such studies suggest that the choice of motif arrange-
ment within a particular culture is very important.

synchronic:  pertaining  to  phenomena  at  one  point  in  time,  occurring 
simultaneously or at the same time; referring to a single period of time.
This approach is not primarily concerned with change and often refers
to  the  correlation  of  events  or  surfaces  of  stratigraphic  units.  [see
diachronic]

T

taap knife: a type of saw knife used in Western Australia. It was made

of small stone chips mounted in a row on a wooden handle.

tablet:  any  ﬂat  surface  for  inscriptions,  especially  those  on  which
cuneiform inscriptions were written. Tablets were normally of clay but
were also made of stone or metal. The shape and size varied accord-
ing  to  the  nature  of  the  inscription  and  the  period  when  the  tablet
was inscribed. An impressed tablet is one bearing notations impressed
with tokens or the blunt end of a stylus. These tablets were referred
to in literature as numerical tablets as they noted units of goods. Incised
and pictographic tablets bear notations traced with the sharp end of
a stylus; these two types of tablets had signs in the shape of the things
they  represented.  The  earliest  known  books  are  the  clay  tablets  of
Mesopotamia (and the papyrus rolls of Egypt) dating from the early
3rd millennium bc. [clay tablet]

tack: a small nail in cut or round form, used to fasten carpet or fabric

to wood and for similar light fastening jobs.

talisman: a charm or fetish thought to produce unusual, extraordinary
happenings. The object often bears a sign or engraved character and
is thought to act as a charm to avert evil and bring good fortune. A
talisman may be worn to protect a person from dangers.

Tana ware: pottery of early Swahili communities of the late 1st millen-
nium ad, found from the Lamu Archipelago off the Kenyan coast as
far south as Vilanculos Bay in Mozambique, as well as on the islands
of Zanzibar, Pemba, Comoros, and Madagascar. [Early Kitchen ware,
Swahili ware]

tang:  narrow  projection  or  prong  from  the  base  of  a  tool  or  weapon

that could be used to secure it to a handle or shaft.

312

TANGED  POINT

tanged point: a projectile point, typically triangular or leaf-shaped, with

a small projection at the base for attachment to a shaft.

tank: a large container or reservoir for liquids or gases.
tankard: a large drinking cup, usually with a single handle and a hinged

cover and slightly angled side walls. [mug]

t’ao t’ieh: Chinese term for a Neolithic design put on jade objects of the
Liangzhu culture and then used on bronze in the Shang period. In the
Shang (18th to 12th century bc) and Zhou/Chou (1111 to c. 900 bc)
dynasties,  it  was  a  zoomorphic  monster  mask  seen  full  face  with  a
gaping mouth and no lower jaw, and the eyes, ears, and horns placed
symmetrically  on  either  side  of  a  vertical  frontal  line.  The  t’ao  t’ieh
often consisted of two kui (dragons facing each other, also symmet-
rical, with the body in proﬁle, a winding tail, and clawed feet). The
t’ao t’ieh is the most important of a number of such patterns used to
decorate the bronze vessels. [t’ao t’ie, taotie]

tap: an object inserted into a barrel to allow liquid to be drawn from it.
tapa:  paperlike  bark  cloth  of  the  Paciﬁc  Islands  made  by  soaking  and
then  beating  the  inner  bark  of  the  paper  mulberry  tree.  It  was  used
for paintings in Oceanic arts.

Tassilo Chalice: copper–gilt chalice of Kremsmünster Abbey, Austria, which
has survived from c. ad 778–788. It is an outstanding and original object,
possibly made by Northumbrian craftsmen, decorated with a combina-
tion of Hiberno-Saxon ornament typical of the period. The chalice is
cast in bronze overlaid with gilt and silver Niello engravings.

Tating  ware:  distinctive  type  of  ceramic  pitcher  probably  made  in  the
Rhineland during the 8th century ad. It is readily recognizable because
it was decorated with applied tin foil. Tating ware was widely traded
to sites along the North Sea and English Channel coasts and beyond.
tazza:  a  cuplike  vessel  with  a  stem  and  foot,  light-colored  fabric,  and
decorated with bands of frilling – possibly used as lamps or in rituals.
[tazzae (pl.)]

teapot: a pot with a handle, spout, and lid, in which tea is prepared.
technofact:  an  artifact  that  was  used  for  a  practical  function,  such 
as providing food, shelter, or defense, rather than connected to social
or ideological activity. The term is also more generally applied to archae-
ological data resulting from past technological activities.

technofunction:  the  use  of  an  artifact  for  practical  purposes;  e.g., 
garments  offering  warmth  or  protection.  [technofunctional,  tech-
nomic (adj.)]

technological analysis: study of technological methods used to make an

artifact.

technological attribute: characteristics of an artifact that are the direct
result  of  how  it  was  made  (manufacturing  methods)  or  due  to  the 

TEMPLE  MOUND  PERIOD

raw material used (constituents) – which lead to technological classi-
ﬁcations. [technological style, technological type]

technology: one of the three basic components of culture; the systematic
study of techniques for making and doing things. It is the means by
which humans have developed things to help them adapt to and exploit
their environment. By virtue of his nature as a toolmaker, humans have
been technologists from the beginning, and the history of technology
encompasses the whole evolution of humans.

technomic: a category of material culture inferred to have served prin-

cipally technological ends, such as cutting or piercing.

technomic  artifact:  a  tool  used  primarily  to  cope  with  the  physical 

tegula: any ﬂat rectangular roof tile with ﬂanges running down the longer

environment.

sides.

tegula  mammata:  a  rectangular  tile  with  conical  projections  or  ﬂanges
at each corner on one side, ﬁxed to walls with clamps in order to form
cavities through which hot gases from a hypocaust circulated.

temmoku: dark brown or blackish Chinese stoneware made for domestic
use mainly during the Sung dynasty (ad 960–1279) and into the early
14th century. The stoneware bowls had a lustrous iron or manganese
black or brown glaze. This is a Japanese term applied to Chinese bowls
used in the tea ceremony until the late 16th century. Some Japanese
bowls are called temmoku solely on account of their similarity of shape
and do not have the glaze. These bowls were highly valued when the
tea ceremony ﬁrst started (15th century) and were classiﬁed accord-
ing to seven types of glazing decoration. In China, this stoneware is
called Chien ware. [Temmoku ware, Tenmoku ware]

temper: coarse material such as sand or shell added to ﬁne pot clay to

make it bond during ﬁring. [tempering agent; tempering (adj.)]

tempering: a process for hardening or strengthening (metal or glass) by

the application of heat or by heating and cooling.

Temple Mound period: time period from c. ad 800 to European colon-
ization  when  Native  Americans  of  the  Mississippian  tradition  built 
large ﬂat-topped earthen structures (platform mounds) designed to func-
tion as artiﬁcial mountains elevating their temples above the landscape.
This period followed the Burial Mound period and is the most recent
period of a chronological construction relating to the whole of east-
ern North American prehistory (formulated by J. A. Ford and Godon
Willey).  The  periods  are:  Paleoindian,  Archaic,  Burial  Mound,  and
Temple Mound. The Temple Mound period is divided into two sub-
periods: Temple Mound I (ad 800–1200), the establishment and rise
of  the  Mississippian  tradition;  and  Temple  Mound  II  (1200–1700),
the peak and then demise of the Mississippian.

314

TEMPORAL  CONTEXT

temporal context: age or date of an archaeological ﬁnd and its temporal

(time) relation to other objects in the archaeological record.

temporal type: a morphological (structure, form) type that has been shown

to have temporal signiﬁcance. [time-marker]

tendril: in early Celtic art, a plant motif of running loops or spirals.
tenoned: joined by a knob (tenon) ﬁtting into a socket or mortise, and
speciﬁcally said of the end of a piece of wood shaped to ﬁt into another
piece.

tenoned mosaic: a mosaic design formed when a series of stone sculp-
tures are set into the exterior facade of a masonry building, such as
by the Maya at Copán, in Honduras. The front of the stone was carved
with a face or symbol, the middle and rear parts formed a long tenon
that anchored the stone in the interior ﬁll of the building. The mosaic
design also carried a symbolic message.

tenterhook: a hook used to support cloth on a tenter frame, after pulling,

to dry the cloth.

Tepeu: Late Classic phase dated to ad 600–900, one of two Lowland
Maya  chronological  phases  or  cultures  (the  other  being  the  Tzakol,
Early  Classic,  c.  ad 250).  It  is  deﬁned  by  a  complex  of  cultural 
materials, especially the polychrome vase; the typical shape is a tall, 
cylindrical vessel with a ﬂat base and decorated with life scenes often
involving  mythological  creatures  and  a  band  of  hieroglyphs.  The
Tepeu culture saw the full ﬂorescence of Maya achievements. It ended
with the downfall and abandonment of the central subregion.

termination:  cross-sectional  shape  of  the  distal  end  of  a  ﬂake  –  which

can be feathered, hinged, plunging, or stepped.

terminus  ante  quem:  Latin  phrase  meaning  “the  end  before  which”  –
that is the date before which a stratum, feature, or artifact must have
been  deposited.  The  term  is  used  either  to  deﬁne  a  relative  chrono-
logical date for artifacts or to provide ﬁxed points in a site’s stratig-
raphy. Sometimes a deposit can be securely dated by material found
in it – for example, coins dating to the 2nd century ad found above
a layer would provide that deposit with a terminus ante quem of the
2nd century ad. In some circumstances, such a “date” may be com-
bined  with  a  terminus  post  quem from  an  earlier  phase  to  produce 
a date range for the intervening deposit. This type of dating is used
to show that something cannot be later than, or earlier than, some-
thing else.

terminus post quem: Latin phrase meaning “the end after which” – that
is the date after which a stratum, feature, or artifact must have been
deposited.  The  term  is  used  either  to  deﬁne  a  relative  chronological
date for artifacts or to provide ﬁxed points in a site’s stratigraphy. If a
deposit contains dateable coins or pottery, then deposits stratigraph-

TERTIARY

315

ically later must be of a later date than that given by such material;
the dated layer gives a terminus post quem for the undated deposit.
In some circumstances, if combined with a terminus ante quem, the
deposit may be dated securely between the two.

terra  cotta:  literally  “baked  earth”  or  “baked  clay,”  terra  cotta  is 
ﬁred  clay  that  is  incompletely  ﬁred  and  still  porous.  It  was  used  to
make artifacts such as vessels, ﬁgurines, tablets, spindle whorls, loom
weights, or net sinkers. Much ancient pottery and other ﬁred clay objects
were made of terra cotta. It is also found as a structural material in
hearths and kilns, where the clay which was used to build them has
been baked in use. A special variety of terra cotta called “daub” was
produced  only  by  accidental  burning.  Today,  the  term  is  applied  to
statuary, building materials, etc. rather than the better ﬁred modern
pottery. [terracotta]

terra nigra: a black or silver-gray colored Gallo-Belgic ware made in Gaul
c. 1st century bc to mid 1st century ad, usually with the name of the
potter or workshop stamped on the inner surface of the base. Terra
rubra is the same as this, but red in color.

terra  sigillata:  a  type  of  ﬁne,  mass-produced  Roman  pottery  of  the 
imperial period, usually red-glazed or red-glossed and moldmade, to
which  stamps  bearing  the  name  of  the  potter  were  applied.  Made 
in  several  centers,  it  was  exported  through  western  Europe  and  the
Mediterranean;  it  can  be  a  very  accurate  chronological  indicator. 
The best known is the plain and relief-decorated pottery of the 1st to
3rd centuries ad from southern, central, and eastern Gaul (called Samian
ware) and also made in Italy and Germany. Another type is the Arretine
of c. 30 bc to ad 50. Generically related or derivative of terra sigillata
are  the  late  Roman  Argonne  or  Marne  wares,  and  North  African
(African red slip) and eastern red wares.

terret: a ring through which the driving reins of a chariot or horse-drawn

vehicle are passed. [terret ring]

Tertiary: the geological period following the Mesozoic (Secondary) era,
constituting the ﬁrst of two periods of the Cenozoic era, the second
being  the  Quaternary.  It  comprises  the  epochs  Paleocene,  Eocene,
Oligocene,  Miocene,  and  Pliocene.  It  extended  from  the  end  of  the
Cretaceous to the beginning of the Quaternary, from 66.4 to 1.6 mil-
lion years ago (mya). The Miocene and Pliocene epochs were impor-
tant in hominid evolution. Some prefer not to use the term Tertiary
and instead divide the interval into two periods, the Paleogene period
(66.4–23.7 mya)  and  the  Neogene  period  (23.7–1.6 mya).  Most  of
the  existing  mountain  belts  and  ranges,  notably  the  Andes,  the
Rockies, the Alps, the Himalayas, and the Atlas Mountains, were formed
either partly or wholly during the Tertiary. The emergence and sub-

316

TERTIARY

mergence  of  land  bridges  between  continents,  especially  between
North  and  South  America,  Eurasia  and  Africa,  and  Asia  and  North
America,  critically  affected  the  migration  of  faunas  and  ﬂoras.  The
earliest generally accepted hominid fossils, those of Australopithecus,
come from rocks of Pliocene age (5.3–1.6 mya) in eastern Africa.

tertiary ﬂake: a ﬂake having no cortex. [interior ﬂake, noncortical ﬂake,

production ﬂake]

tessellated: pertaining to a Roman ﬂoor or other surface decorated with

tesserae; inlaid or mosaic work composed of tesserae.

tessera: a piece of stone, colored glass, or tile used with others to make
mosaic patterns on ﬂoors, walls, ceilings, etc. The pieces were set in
cement by Roman and later craftsmen. Small cubes of up to 2.5 cm
(1 inch) in size were used to make the ﬂoors. In the Roman period,
tesserae, sometimes inscribed, were in circulation for various purposes.
These were small tokens of bronze, lead, terra cotta, and bone. The
earliest  tesserae,  which  by  200 bc had  replaced  natural  pebbles  in
Hellenistic mosaics, were cut from marble and limestone. Stone tesserae
dominated  mosaics  into  Roman  times,  but  between  the  3rd  and 
1st  centuries  bc tesserae  of  smalto  (colored  glass)  also  began  to  be
produced.  An  important  variety  of  glass  tesserae,  appearing  ﬁrst  in
Roman  mosaics  of  the  4th  century  ad,  were  those  made  with  gold
and silver leaf. [tesserae (pl.); tessellated (adj.)]

tetrastyle: four columns forming the façade of a Classical building such
as Naiskos; also, four columns placed in a square pattern, such as at
the four corners of an impluvium within the atrium of a Roman house.
textile: fabric produced by spinning and weaving ﬁbers, whether of animal
or vegetable origin. Fragments may be preserved by waterlogging and
tanning, by desiccation, or by corrosion of copper or bronze lying along-
side. More commonly, items such as spindle whorls, weaving combs,
and loom weights attest the existence of textile production.

texture: 1. Size, shape, and arrangement of grains or crystals in rocks and
also a property of soil, sediment, or similar material. Soil texture class
names are assigned to indicate speciﬁc ranges of percentage of sand, silt,
and  clay.  As  with  particle  size,  several  different  systems  of  texture
classiﬁcation  are  in  use,  including  the  British  Standard  1377  system
and  the  United  States  Department  of  Agriculture  system.  For  rocks,
there  are  also  classiﬁcation  schemes.  The  texture  of  artifacts  is  one
property used to help identify the source material, conditions, and envir-
onment of deposition or crystallization and recrystallization, and sub-
sequent  geological  history  and  change.  2.  In  ceramic  analysis,  the 
appearance of the ceramic paste as determined by clay particle size.
Thames pick: a large, coarsely chipped Mesolithic tranchet ax and other
long ﬂint tools with tranchet-shaped points found in the River Thames.

THREE  AGE  SYSTEM

317

thatch:  traditional  style  of  rooﬁng  used  in  many  parts  of  the  world  at
different times whereby bundles of organic material such as reed, straw,
heather, turf, or ling are tied together over a wooden frame with the
long  axis  of  the  plant  ﬁber  parallel  to  the  slope  of  the  roof  to  pro-
vide good weather-prooﬁng.

thatch weight: heavy stone or ceramic object, usually with a perforation
or  groove  so  that  it  can  be  attached  to  a  rope  or  net,  used  to  hold
rooﬁng thatch in place.

therianthrope: depiction in rock art combining aspects of two or more

species, especially a human and an animal.

Thericleian  ware:  a  type  of  decoration  of  the  5th  to  3rd  centuries  bc
used on silver, terebinth wood (pistachio), and clay. It is characterized
by ribbing and a black color. Therikles, a Corinthian potter, was said
to have developed the technique.

Thetford ware: a wheel-turned late Saxon pottery made near Thetford
in Norfolk, England, from the late 9th century to early 12th century.
The fabric is hard, sandy, and gray to buff; the mass-produced wares 
were cooking pits and jars with limited rouletting and applied thumb
decoration.

thimble: a small metal, clay, or bone cap to protect the ﬁnger while sewing.
Thin Orange pottery: a thin-walled, orange-ﬁred ware with a distinctive
mica schist temper and a decoration of incised and dotted patterns of
Mesoamerica. It was introduced in the late Pre-Classic period and widely
traded in Mesoamerica during the Classic period. It has been found
in Colima, Jalisco, Nayarit, Kaminaljuyú, Copán, Monte Albán, and
Teotihuacán. It is regarded as evidence of central Mexican inﬂuence,
although its probable point of origin is the Valley of Puebla. It should
not be confused with the early Post-Classic Fine Orange ware. [Thin
Orange ware]

thinning: decreasing the thickness of an artifact, or a portion of an arti-
fact, by extensive ﬂaking. Basal thinning refers to the removal of thick-
ness from the hafting area by means of ﬂake removal.

Third Intermediate Period: a chronological phase (1075–656 bc) following
the New Kingdom, when Egypt was divided. The north was inherited
by the Tanite 21st dynasty (c. 1075–950 bc), and much of the Nile
Valley came under the control of the Theban priests.

Three Age System: the division of human prehistory into three succes-
sive  stages  –  Stone  Age,  Bronze  Age,  and  Iron  Age  –  based  on  the
main type of material used in tools of the period. The system was ﬁrst
formulated by Christian J. Thomsen in 1819 as a means of classify-
ing the collections in the National Museum of Denmark. The scheme
became progressively elaborated by dividing the Stone Age into Old
and New (Paleolithic and Neolithic). A Middle Stone Age or Mesolithic

Thumbnail scrapers

318

THREE  AGE  SYSTEM

was later added. The further subdivisions Early, Middle, and Late of
the  Paleolithic  (Lower,  Middle,  and  Upper)  were  introduced,  and  a
Copper  Age  was  inserted  between  the  New  Stone  and  Bronze  Ages.
The ages are only developmental stages and some areas skipped one
or  more  of  the  stages.  At  ﬁrst  entirely  hypothetical,  these  divisions 
were  later  conﬁrmed  by  archaeological  observations.  It  established 
the  principle  that  by  classifying  artifacts,  one  could  produce  a
chronological ordering.

throat: base of a neck or collar on a vessel; the point of maximum diam-

eter restriction of a neck or collar.

throw: to form a ceramic object on a potter’s wheel, making use of the
centrifugal force produced by rapid rotation of the wheel. [throwing (n.)]
thrusting spear: a handheld spear used for stabbing rather than throwing.
thumbnail scraper: a small convex scraper the size and shape of a thumb-
nail,  found  in  both  Pleistocene  and  Holocene  contexts  in  Australia.
Finely  worked  examples  are  part  of  the  Australian  Small  Tool  tra-
dition. They are increasingly reported from Pleistocene sites and are
a distinctive feature of southwestern Tasmanian Pleistocene and Victoria
assemblages from about 24,000 years ago.

Tiefstichkeramik: a style of pottery decoration used by the Funnel Beaker
culture  of  Germany  and  Holland  c.  3000–2700 bc.  The  decoration
consists of short, deeply incised bands and zigzags. The style is asso-
ciated with the hunebed tombs.

tile: thin, ﬂat slab or block used structurally or decoratively in building.
time-marker: a temporally signiﬁcant class of artifacts deﬁned by a con-

sistent clustering of attributes. [horizon marker, time marker]

tin glaze: the process of adding tin oxide to other ingredients during the
glazing of pottery to produce an opaque, white-enameled effect. It was
used from c. 1000 bc by the Assyrians; in the 8th to 9th centuries ad,
Persian and Islamic potters rediscovered the technique and it was trans-
mitted to Spain, Italy, France, and Holland. Tin glaze was probably
ﬁrst used to hide faults of color in the body, for most clays contain
a variable amount of iron that colors the body from buff to dark red.
Tin-glazed  wares  look  somewhat  as  though  they  have  been  covered
with thick white paint. [tin-glazed (adj.)]

tinder box: a box containing tinder (any dry inﬂammable material), and

usually also ﬂint and steel for lighting ﬁres.

Ting: a type of cream-colored Chinese porcelain made in China, mainly
in the form of tripod bowls, during the Sung (ad 960–1279) and Yüan
(1280–1368)  dynasties.  Ting  ware  may  be  either  plain  or  decorated
with incised, molded, impressed, or carved designs. Characteristic forms
include bowls, cups, and dishes. Fired upside down, many pieces, especi-
ally bowls, have an unglazed rim banded with metal. [Ding, Ting ware]

Togolok:  Late  Bronze  Age  sites  in  the  Murghab  delta,  Turkmenia, 
with  a  material  culture  similar  to  the  Bactrian  Late  Bronze  Age.
Togolok  is  also  a  chronological  phase,  around  the  second  quarter 
of  the  2nd  millennium  bc,  with  continuity  to  the  preceding  Gonur 
phase.

token: small artifacts, generally of clay, made into one of 16 types: cones,
spheres,  disks,  cylinders,  tetrahedrons,  ovoids,  rectangles,  triangles,
biconoids, paraboloids, bent coils, ovals, vessels, tools, animals, or mis-
cellaneous.  Such  objects  were  used  on  Early  Neolithic  sites  in  west-
ern Asia as counters to keep records of goods. A plain token was typical
of the periods between 8000 and 4300 bc and after 3100 bc. The shapes
were  mostly  restricted  to  cones,  spheres,  disks,  cylinders,  and  tetra-
hedrons; the surface was usually plain. Complex tokens were typical
of the 4th millennium bc temple administration and include all 16 types
of  tokens.  Complex  tokens  are  characterized  by  an  extensive  use  of
markings – linear, punctuated, or appliqué. Researchers (especially Diane
Schmandt-Besserat) suggest that tokens were the precursor of writing
as  they  began  to  be  placed  within  clay  bullae  (envelopes)  that  were
marked with a cylinder seal representing the content of the bullae. This
led to writing numbers on a tablet, and then to words.

tomahawk:  a  light  ax  formerly  used  as  a  tool  or  weapon  by  Native

Americans.

tombstone: a stone placed across a grave. [gravestone]
tone: a mixture of light (white) and shade (black) with a color.
tongs: a tool with two movable arms that are joined at one end, used

for picking up and holding things.

tongue chape: elongated metal ﬁtting with a triangular outline which ﬁt
on the end of a scabbard to prevent the tip of the sword cutting through
the leather.

tool:  any  existing  physical  object  that  is  in  some  way  fashioned  or 
altered  by  humans  and  employed  for  a  speciﬁc  task  or  purpose. 
Tools  made  of  stone  included  axes,  adzes,  arrowheads,  spearheads,
daggers,  knife  blades,  scrapers,  borers,  burins,  picks,  etc.  The  ﬁrst 
tools  date  back  to  c.  2,600,000  years  ago,  the  beginning  of  the
Paleolithic  age,  and  are  different-sized  pebble  tools  called  choppers.
The  chopper  was  the  only  tool  used  by  people  for  almost  2  million
years, until the appearance of the hand ax, a superior (and sharper)
version of the chopper.

TOOLKIT

toolkit: a term for all the tools used by a given culture for its technology
(spatially patterned), or for a set of tools used together for a speciﬁc
task (functionally patterned). [tool kit]

Toprakkale: site on Lake Van, eastern Anatolia (Turkey), which was the
center of the Urartian state, c. 850–600 bc. There is a large temple
complex consisting of a Urartian fortress, storerooms, and residential
area, including bronze, carved ivory, and silk artifacts. There are other
temples,  storerooms,  etc.  in  the  area  in  which  some  wall  paintings
remain. The walls of Toprakkale, erected in the 8th century bc, were
of cyclopean masonry and sloped slightly inward, perhaps as a defense
against  earthquakes.  Artifacts  show  a  high  level  of  artistic  achieve-
ment,  in  bronze,  gold,  silver,  and  ivory.  Excavations  have  also  un-
covered  a  basalt  ﬂoor  inlaid  with  limestone  and  marble,  parts  of  a
decorated  marble  frieze,  and  brilliantly  polished  red  pottery  vessels.
Toprakkale is also the name of a ﬁne burnished red ware of the Urartian
period. [Topra Kaleh]

torc: a neckring, of gold or bronze, and penannular in shape (an almost-
complete  ring).  Examples  are  made  of  spirally  twisted  metal  and
appeared  in  the  Early  Bronze  Age  of  central  Europe  and  continued
until the Roman occupation, being particularly popular among the Celts.
They were very common in the La Tène Iron Age, and examples made
of gold, silver, and electrum occur in graves and hoards. [torque]

Torksey-type  ware:  a  style  of  late  Saxon  pottery  of  central  England, 
dating from c. ad 850 to 1150 and made using a fast wheel at work-
shops around Torksey, Lincolnshire.

torsade: a decorative band in which two ribbons twist in a regular pat-
tern around a row of circles. In the double torsade, three ribbons twist
around two rows of circles.

tortoise  core:  in  stone  toolmaking,  a  distinctive  core  having  the  shape
of  a  tortoise  shell  and  characteristic  of  the  Levalloisian  culture.  A 
nodule of ﬂint is prepared to form a core resembling a tortoise, from
which ﬂakes are struck.

totem:  any  object  from  the  natural  world,  usually  an  animal,  with
which a particular clan or tribe considers itself to have a special asso-
ciation or even blood relationship. It is also the term for a representa-
tion  of  such  in  an  emblem  or  badge  or  a  group  of  people  within  a
Native American nation who share the same totem.

touchstone: a stone used to test how genuine an object is by rubbing the
object against the stone, particularly used for testing gold and silver.
tournette: a turntable that was rotated manually to assist in the manu-
facture of a pot. They were used in Mesopotamia from about 5000 bc.
It was a forerunner of the potter’s wheel (c. 3400 bc).

toy: an object for a child to play with, typically a model or miniature

replica of a thing.

TRANSVERSE  PLANE

trace: any physical characteristic of an artifact that can be described.
traceology: study of the traces left by use on the cutting edges of stone

tools, with the aid of a microscope.

tracer: a tool for marking out or engraving designs, used to outline the
raised  areas  on  a  surface.  In  metalworking,  a  tracer  was  frequently
used to outline the raised areas on the surface of repoussé metalwork.
A tracer is worked by hammering.

trade: the transmission of material objects from one society to another;
the buying and selling or exchange of commodities between nations
or  trading  parties.  Trade  is  a  descriptive  cultural  model  used  in  the
culture historical approach.

trait: any element of human culture – material or nonmaterial – or tech-
nology. This term can be used for any individual artifact or aspect of
man’s culture, ranging from monument or artifact types to social or
ritual practices.

tranchet: a large Mesolithic or Neolithic chisel-ended ﬂint artifact with
a sharp straight cutting edge, produced by the removal of a thick ﬂake
at a right angle to the main axis of the tool. The technique was used
for the manufacture of axes and adzes and allowed a blunted tool to
be resharpened by removing another ﬂake from across the edge. The
tranchet technique has two deﬁnitions: (1) the removal of a large ﬂat
ﬂake from the tip of a biface to form a straight cutting edge from the
edge of the tranchet ﬂake scar; or (2) the technique used to create or
resharpen  the  ax  or  adze’s  cutting  edge.  [tranchet  ax,  tranchet  axe,
tranchet ﬂake, tranchet technique]

transfer  printing:  a  technique,  invented  in  England  in  the  1750s,  of 
decorating  enamels  and  ceramics  with  engraved  designs  that  are
printed  on  to  paper  using  a  special  ceramic  ink.  The  paper  is  then
pressed  against  the  surface  of  the  enamel  or  ceramic  and  the  design
thus transferred.

transitional:  a  term  used  to  describe  an  artifact  that  was  utilized  and

manufactured across two or more cultural periods.

translucent:  chipped  material  that  transmits  a  certain  amount  of  light,

usually indicating high quality.

transverse  arrowhead:  a  type  of  ﬂint  or  stone  projectile  tip,  having  a 
trapezoidal  outline  with  the  wider  straight  end  forming  the  leading
edge, and of the later Mesolithic in northern Europe. [petit-tranchet
arrowhead]

transverse ﬂaking: a technique similar to oblique ﬂaking, but the ﬂake

scars lie at right angles to the central line of the artifact.

transverse line: an imaginary line extending across the center of a pro-

jectile, halfway between the distal tip and the basal edge.

transverse plane: plane parallel to the stance of a pot or perpendicular

to the longitudinal axis in a piece of wood.

322

TRANSVERSE  SECTION

transverse section: a cross-section where the cut is made parallel to the
base line of the artifact drawing and the outline of the section keeps
the front surface at the top.

transverse striae: linear mark, ridge, or groove situated or extending across

something.

trapeze:  a  geometric  microlith  whose  outline  has  four  sides  –  two  lat-
eral, nearly parallel sides with the longer one being the cutting edge
and  the  shorter  opposite  edge  backed  or  not  backed;  the  remaining
distal and proximal sides are backed obliquely at an angle to both the
cutting edge and to each other.

travois:  native  American  vehicle  consisting  of  two  joined  poles  (trans-
versely connected wooden shafts) pulled by a horse or dog (dragged
at an angle to the ground). Found in North America, it is believed to
be the ﬁrst vehicle used by humans.

tray: a thin ﬂat board or plate usually with a raised edge on which things

can be carried.

treasure trove: in law, treasure found hidden in the ground, etc., but of
unknown  ownership.  In  Britain,  treasure  troves  are  the  property  of
the State, though sometimes they are in part returned or recompensed
to the owner of the land. To be declared treasure trove by a coroner’s
inquest, the items must be of gold or silver, and must have been lost
or hidden with the intention of recovery by someone who is no longer
traceable. In these circumstances, the Crown takes possession, reward-
ing  the  ﬁnder  with  the  market  value  or  with  the  object  itself  if  it  is
not required for the national collections.

tree-trunk  cofﬁn:  a  tree  trunk  cut  longitudinally  and  hollowed  out  for
use as a cofﬁn, with the other side used as the lid, of the British Isles
about the early 2nd millennium bc. [monoxylous cofﬁns]

trenail: a wooden cylinder or dowel used for pinning planks or timbers

together.

trencher:  a  shallow  dish  or  plate  used  to  serve  main  meals  off  or  to 
serve  sweetmeats,  these  usually  being  painted  with  devices  and 
riddles.

triangle:  a  geometric  microlith  that  has  one  side  with  a  sharp  cutting

edge and two other sides shaped by backing.

triangular: a projectile, knife, perform, or blade that has three sides or

roughly has the shape of a triangle.

triangular  loom  weight:  a  small  triangular  block  of  baked  clay  with 
parallel sides and perforations through the corners for attachment to
the  warp  threads  on  an  upright  loom.  Found  from  the  later  Bronze
Age and Iron Age in the British Isles.

triaxial body: a modern prepared clay body consisting of a clay, an aggreg-

ate or ﬁller, and a ﬂux.

Triangular

TRUNCATION

tribunal:  in  Roman  architecture,  a  raised  platform  in  a  basilica  on
which the magistrates’ seats were placed. It was also the rostrum, or
raised  platform,  from  which  the  commander  of  a  fort  spoke  to  his
assembled men or dealt out justice.

trident: a weapon with a long shaft and a three-pronged head.
trigonolith:  in  the  West  Indies,  a  triangular  or  breast-shaped  stone
object, with or without decoration, usually representing a zemi. Small
pottery or shell examples can also be found. [three-cornered stone]

trimming: cutting material away from the surface of a leather-hard pot-
tery vessel with a tool, such as a lithic ﬂake held at an acute angle to
the vessel surface, to removed traces of the seam.

tripartite urn: an Early Bronze Age collared urn of the British Isles with
a  body  of  three  distinct  components  or  sections:  a  trunco-conic  or 
ogee body, a concave neck, and a collar which is usually angled but
occasionally vertical.

triple vase: a Roman vessel of three small jars, either attached to the top

of a tubular ring-base or joined together at the body.

tripod: a set of three leg- or knoblike supports attached to the base of

a vessel to raise it above the surface.

tripod  pitcher:  a  large  jug  for  liquids  with  three  small  legs  projecting
from the base for support; of the medieval period in northwest Europe.
trireme:  earliest  type  of  Greek  warship  which  used  a  battering  ram  in
the prow as its main weapon, and was named for the three banks of
oars by which it was propelled.

trivet:  a  ceramic,  stone,  or  metal  stand  on  which  a  cooking  pot  or 

kettle is set for support or to protect a surface.

Trojan War: legendary conﬂict between the early Greeks and the people
of Troy in western Anatolia, dated by later Greek authors to the 12th
or 13th centuries bc and lasting 10 years. It was described in Homer’s
Iliad and Odyssey as occurring when Paris, son of the king of Troy,
eloped with Helen, wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta. Menelaus’s brother,
Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, raised an army and besieged Troy.

trolling lure: a ﬁshing device towed behind a moving boat.
trumpet: a brass wind musical instrument sounded by lip vibration against
a cup mouthpiece. It has been made of horn, conch, reed, or wood,
with  a  horn  or  gourd  bell,  as  well  as  the  modern  brass  instrument.
The metal trumpet dates from the 2nd millennium bc in Egypt, when
it was a small ritual or military instrument sounding only one or two
notes.  In  the  Late  Bronze  Age  it  was  made  by  riveting  sheet  bronze
into the shape of a cattle horn.

truncation:  the  process  that  produces,  and  the  tool  type  that  exhibits,
drastic redirection of outline in the artifact’s distal or proximal area,
effected by steep retouch.

324

TRUNDHOLM

Trundholm: site where a bronze-wheeled model of a horse pulling a disk,
dated  to  c.  1650 bc,  was  found  in  the  Trundholm  bog  in  Zealand,
Denmark.  It  probably  represented  a  chariot  of  the  sun  and  was
deposited as a ritual offering.

trunnion: either of a pair of cylindrical mounting lugs or projections on
the sides of a cannon or mortar, by which it is pivoted on its carriage.
A  trunnion  is  also  one  of  a  pair  of  laterally  projecting  knobs  on  a
stone or metal blade (ax, chisel, etc.) to assist in its hafting.

Tudor green ware: a type of pottery made in southeastern England in the
16th century ad with thick green or yellow glaze over a light-colored body.
tula adze: in Australia, a hafted chisel made to work hardwoods. It is
a thick, round, stone ﬂake, usually about 5 cm (2 inches) long, with
a  steeply  trimmed  working  edge  opposite  an  obtuse-angled  striking
platform. They usually have a prominent bulb and convex bulbar sur-
face. Ethnographic examples are set in gum on the end of a wooden
handle or spear thrower. The edge would be resharpened until the ﬂake
became  elliptical,  when  it  would  be  discarded.  In  this  form,  with  a
heavily step-ﬂaked edge opposite the striking platform, it is termed a
“tula adze slug.” Tula adzes are restricted to more arid regions and
the  oldest  examples  come  from  Puntutjarpa  (c.  8000–5000 bc)  and
are exactly like those still used by desert Aborigines. [tula]

tulang  mawas:  literally  “monkey  bone,”  a  long-shafted,  socketed  iron

ax of Iron Age peninsular Malaysia, c. 300 bc.

tumbler: a ﬂat-bottomed drinking vessel with no handle or stem.
tumbrel: a balance for weighing coins.
tunnel handle: in pottery, a handle ﬂush with the surface of the pot. It
is usually produced by piercing two adjacent holes in the wall of the
vessel before ﬁring and adding a pouch of clay inside to prevent the
contents from escaping. The feature was widely used around the west-
ern Mediterranean c. 3500–2000 bc. [subcutaneous handle]

Turin Papyrus: a hieratic manuscript of the 19th dynasty of Egypt which
lists the kings of Egypt from earliest times to the reign of Ramses II
(1279–1213 bc), under whom it was written. The papyrus is now in
the Egyptian Museum in Turin, Italy, in very fragmentary condition,
but it is still considered the most detailed and reliable of the existing
Egyptian king lists. It lists not only names but also regnal years, months,
and  days  and  also  divides  pharaonic  history  into  dynasties  and  into
three major periods – the Old Kingdom, Middle Kingdom, and New
Kingdom. It was evidently copied from a more complete original. [Turin
Canon, Turin Papyrus of Kings, Turin Royal Canon]

turning: 1. In making wooden artifacts, a reductive forming technique
using a lathe to rotate a piece of wood and a mainly stationary chisel
to  remove  material  from  it.  2.  In  pottery  making,  a  reductive  form-

turquoise: a phosphate gemstone, sky blue to pale green, which forms
as veins and nodules in the ﬁssures of sandstone and trachyte. It was
mined by the Egyptians from the late Predynastic period onwards and
was almost as highly prized as jade in Mesoamerica. It was also highly
prized  for  jewelry  in  western  Asia  and  the  American  southwest.
Turquoise was obtained from the Sinai peninsula before the 4th mil-
lennium bc in one of the world’s ﬁrst important hard-rock mining oper-
ations.  It  was  transported  to  Europe  through  Turkey,  probably
accounting for its name, which is French for “Turkish.”

tussah: a type of strong, coarse, tan-colored silk obtained from the cocoon
of wild silkworms in China and India (the products of various Asiatic
Saturniidae, such as Antheraea paphia).

tutulus: a circular bronze ornament worn at the waist by women during

the Bronze Age in Denmark.

tuyère: a metal nozzle through which air is forced into a forge, hearth,
kiln, or furnace from the bellows. In antiquity it was usually of clay,
and often survives as the only evidence for a metalworking site. This
short  tube  made  of  clay,  through  which  the  air  from  bellows  could
be blown into a furnace, was used to produce the high temperatures
required for metalworking and smelting.

tweezers: small pinchers used to pluck out hairs, and for other purposes.
twining: basketry made with a horizontal stitch or weft; a technique of
textile or basket weaving in which the wefts are inserted in pairs, and
twine around one another as they embrace each successive warp. The
warp  is  relatively  rigid  and  the  weft  is  relatively  pliable.  [twined 
basketry; twined (adj.)]

twist: the direction that cordage was rolled in its manufacture – either

S-twist or Z-twist.

tyg: a drinking vessel with two or more handles.
type: a classiﬁcation of artifacts based on the shared attributes of groups
of  artifacts  or  features,  such  as  pottery  types,  projectile  point  types,
or  house  types.  The  class  is  deﬁned  by  a  consistent  clustering  of
attributes. In pottery, it is part of a standardized taxonomic classiﬁca-
tion based on stylistic attributes: modes and varieties (minimal units);
and types, groups, complexes, and spheres (maximal units).

type fossil: a particular artifact form used to deﬁne a speciﬁc period or
culture, such as an Acheulian handax, using a dating concept borrowed
from geology. A speciﬁc artifact can serve to represent the taxon of
which  it  is  a  member.  Such  an  artifact  would  have  a  wide  distribu-
tion in space but a restricted one in time. Its value lies in correlating
cultural sequences over large areas, as in cross-dating. In archaeology,

the time taken for a type to spread by diffusion must be allowed for
and, if possible, calculated from outside evidence. [fossil directeur]

type  series:  arrangement  of  a  particular  form  of  artifact  into  a  series,
usually according to a progression of changes in its shape/form. It may
provide  a  form  of  relative  dating  for  objects  as  well  as  a  means  of
classiﬁcation.

type–variety–mode analysis: a taxonomic classiﬁcation of pottery based
on stylistic attributes that deﬁnes a hierarchy of modes and varieties
(minimal units), types, groups, complexes, and spheres (maximal units).
[type–variety system]

typological  method:  classiﬁcation  of  artifacts  into  types  to  compare 
artifacts  or  features  across  time  and  space,  or  to  determine  relative
dates for sites. [typology]

typology: study of classes with common characteristics; classiﬁcation of
artifacts; or systematic classiﬁcation of artifacts or remains according
to  type,  i.e.,  form  and  decoration.  This  is  the  ﬁrst  step  in  archae-
ological  analysis  and  is  necessary  in  comparing  assemblages  and  in 
determining time sequences. Groups of pottery, for example, may be
assembled  by  those  with  long  necks,  those  with  handles,  and  those
with a pedestal base. Within these may be subgroups based on vari-
ations in handle shape or decoration. The relationships between similar
types can sometimes be shown not merely to classify, but also to explain,
their development – which is called seriation. It may show increasing
complexity or functional improvement, simpliﬁcation and functional
decline, or change based on fashion. Typology may be associated with
chronology,  in  that  it  may  be  possible  to  place  groups  of  the  same
kind of material in a sequence.

tzompantli: skull rack on which, in the Aztec and some other Mesoamer-

ican cultures, the skulls of sacriﬁcial victims were displayed.

Tz’u-chou ware: a large group of Chinese stoneware made in the Chihli,
Hopei,  Honan,  and  Shansi  provinces  and  decorated  in  bold  designs
with contrasting slips and later with enamels. It was produced during
the Sung (ad 960–1279), Yuan (1279–1368), and Ming (1368–1644)
dynasties. Vases, bottles, and other vessels were decorated with simple
brushwork in brown, black, or gray on a white, cream, buff, or turquoise
background;  the  pale  background  was  achieved  by  applying  a  coat-
ing of slip to the body of the vessel before ﬁring. Bold strokes, curves,
splotches, concentric bands, and animals and birds were typical motifs.
Another type of ornamentation consists of incisions in the slip coat-
ing that reveal the contrasting color of the body underneath. [Cizhou]

Ucayali sequence: a 4000-year sequence of the many pottery styles that

have been found at a number of sites near Pucallpa, eastern Peru.

ulu: a transverse-bladed Arctic knife, crescent-shaped, and usually of slate.
The blade of the knife is the lower element of an inverted T and the
handle is the vertical upright element.

umbrella: a folding circular cover on a stick held in the hand for pro-

tection against rain.

umiak: a large, open boat used in Greenland and by other Arctic peoples,
made of seal or other animal skins stretched on a wooden (driftwood)
or whalebone frame. It was called the women’s boat, as opposed to
the kayak – the men’s hunting and ﬁshing boat. It was paddled and
was either round or elongated, like the birchbark canoe. The umiak
was used by women for transporting themselves, children, the elderly,
and possessions. It was also used by the men for whaling.

unbeveled: an edge that is not steeply ﬂaked into a bevel.
underglaze: a type of colored decoration applied to raw or biscuit ware

before the glaze coating is applied.

underworld book: pictorial and textual compositions inscribed in New
Kingdom royal tombs that describe the passage of the sun god through
the  underworld  and  the  sky.  They  probably  imparted  secret  know-
ledge and included hundreds of names of demons and of deities and
other beings who accompanied the sun god in his barque on his jour-
ney through night and day. The texts are in the present tense and form
a description and a series of tableaux rather than a narrative. Private
individuals used them in the Late Period.

unﬂaked: a face that is unaltered by applying ﬂaking.

Unstan  ware:  a  type  of  ﬁnely  made  and  decorated  Neolithic  pottery 
from the 4th millennium bc; elegant, round-based bowls with a band
of  grooved  patterning  below  the  rim,  found  in  the  northern  part  of
the British Isles, especially the Hebrides, Western Isles, and Orkney.

Upper  Paleolithic:  the  ﬁnal  part  of  the  Paleolithic  period,  from  about
40,000 years ago to about 10,000 years ago. It was characterized by
the development of bladed stone tools and regional stone-tool industries
(e.g., Perigordian, Aurignacian, Solutrean, and Magdalenian of Europe),
the  hunting  of  large  herd  animals,  human  burials,  the  appearance 
of  cave  paintings  and  other  art  forms,  and  the  replacement  of  the
Neanderthals with modern humans (Cro-Magnon man). There were
also localized industries in the Old World and the oldest known cul-
tures of the New World. Upper Paleolithic industries exhibited a greater
complexity,  specialization,  and  variety  of  tool  types,  and  distinctive
regional  artistic  traditions  emerged.  The  latter  included  small  sculp-
tures (clay and stone ﬁgurines, ivory carvings), monumental paintings,
incised designs, and reliefs on the walls of caves.

USE-RELATED  PRIMARY  CONTEXT

329

upright loom: a structure on which woven cloth is manufactured, com-
prising  two  more  or  less  vertical  supports  (often  set  in  the  ground)
with a horizontal beam across the top. The warp threads are tied to
the cross-beam so that they hang down, thus allowing the weaver to
move  a  horizontal  shed  rod  between  alternating  sets  of  the  warp  in
order that a shed is opened up for the weft to be threaded through.
The warp threads were tensioned by loom weights. The upright loom
was commonly used in antiquity, traces of them being known in Europe
from the Middle Bronze Age onwards.

uraeus: the coiled cobra of ancient Egypt, worn by the pharaoh on his
brow, usually combined with one or other of the royal crowns, as a
symbol of his supreme authority. The cobra is associated with the god-
dess Wadjit or with the sun, whose eye it is held to be. It is an agent
of destruction and protection of the king, spitting out ﬁre.

Urewe  ware:  a  characteristic  Early  Iron  Age  pottery  type  of  the  inter-
lacustrine region of East Africa: southwest Kenya, northwest Tanzania,
Rwanda, east Zaire, and south Uganda. It dates from the last centuries
bc to the ﬁrst centuries ad and is the name of a tradition of the Chifum-
baze complex. Urewe ware was ancestral to the varied wares of the
Early Iron Age complex further south. Named after a site in southwest
Kenya, the makers of Urewe ware were clearly skilled workers of iron.
Urﬁrnis: characteristic ware of the Middle Neolithic and early Helladic
periods  of  Greece  and  also  the  name  of  a  glaze-like  paint.  The  pot-
tery has a buff fabric decorated with a dark lustrous slip or glaze. The
sauce boat and the askos are the most notable shapes.

urn: any large and decorative vase, especially one having an ornamen-
tal base and no handles, and often used for storage. It is most often
found as a container for the ashes of a cremation burial, the so-called
cinerary urn for jar burials. The term is widely used in the European
Bronze Age, and the name Urnﬁeld cultures, given to the Late Bronze
Age  of  much  of  central,  eastern,  and  southern  Europe,  refers  to  the
characteristic burial rite.

urn cover: a ﬂat piece of stone, wood, or ceramic placed over the open

top of an urn before, during, or after its placement in a burial pit.

use: the third stage of behavioral processes, in which artifacts are utilized

(following acquisition and manufacture, and before deposition).

use life: the length of time a tool or artifact is used before it is discarded;
the sequence a tool goes through from production to discard. [use-life
continuum, uselife]

use  retouch:  an  irregular  scattering  of  small  scars  often  found  on  the
edges of artifacts and thought to be the accidental result of tool use.
use-related primary context: a primary context resulting from abandonment

of materials during either manufacturing or use activities.

330

USE-RELATED  SECONDARY  CONTEXT

use-related  secondary  context:  a  secondary  context  resulting  from  dis-
turbance by human activity after the original deposition of materials.
use-wear analysis: examination and study of the edges and surfaces of
artifacts, mainly stone tools, to determine the type of wear they have
experienced and thus the tasks for which they were used. Microscopic
analysis is used to detect signs of wear on working edges. [microwear
analysis, use-wear, usewear analysis]

use-wear striae: polish, striations, breakage, or minor ﬂaking which develop
on  a  tool’s  edge  during  use.  Microscopic  examination  and  study  of
the wear may indicate the past function of tools. [use-wear stigmata,
usewear stigmata, usewear striae]

ushabti: small wooden or glazed-stone mummiform ﬁgurines placed in
Egyptian tombs of the Middle Kingdom onwards. They were to under-
take  work  on  behalf  of  the  deceased,  who  might  be  called  upon  to
perform manual labor in the afterlife. [shabti]

utilitarian function: physical functions of artifacts as distinguished from

symbolic or ideological functions.

utilized ﬂake: a piece of stone debitage used for cutting or slicing. The

edge may be damaged from use, but not deliberately.

utilized material: pieces of stone that have been used without modiﬁcation.

V

V  perforation:  a  method  of  making  buttons  in  which  two  converging
holes are drilled to meet at an angle below the surface. The technique
was  common  in  Europe  in  the  Copper  and  Early  Bronze  Ages,  and
was used especially among the Beaker folk.

vaisselle  blanche:  a  type  of  ceramics  made  in  the  Aceramic  Neolithic
(PPNB)  of  Syria,  Lebanon,  and  the  east  bank  of  the  Jordan  River. 
It was white, made from lime mixed with ashes, air dried, and some-
times painted in bands.

Valders  Advance:  ﬁnal  advance  of  the  ice  during  the  Wisconsin  glaci-
ation of the Pleistocene in North America, beginning about 12,000 bp
until approximately 10,000 bp.

Valdivia pottery: formative period culture dating to the later 4th millen-
nium bc on the coast of Ecuador, South America, named after a site
of the same name excavated by B. Meggars and C. Evans in the early
1960s. The culture is important in being amongst the earliest in the
region  to  have  a  developed  ceramics  industry  that  used  a  variety  of
plastic  techniques  for  decorative  motifs.  Artifacts  suggest  a  marine-
orientated subsistence pattern.

Valencia: ceramic complex of red-colored jars, one of the best known in
Venezuela and found on a number of mound sites in the north central
part of country. The shapes of huge human ﬁgurines with ﬂat, wide heads
are very distinctive. Typically the pottery is coarse and sand- or mica-
tempered. Decoration may be appliqué work, rectilinear incision, or
modeled human faces with coffee-bean eyes. It dates to c. ad 1000–
1500 and possibly derived from the Arauquim complex or from the
La Cabrera phase of the Barrancoid series. [Valencoid subtradition]
value: intensity, brilliance, or lightness/darkness of a color. In the Munsell
color chart, value is the vertical dimension, varying from dark to light.

332

VAPHEIO

Vapheio: site of a Mycenaean tholos tomb in Laconia, Greece, dated to
the 15th century bc, and giving its name to the style of magniﬁcent
gold cup found there. The most popular shape was straight or slightly
splayed walls widening to the rim, and a single handle – and is decorated
with scenes of bulls. The form occurs in pottery from the middle Minoan
period (late 16th to early 15th century bc) on Crete and was import-
ant to the Mycenaeans in the late Helladic period. Other rich grave
goods found are bronze weapons and ﬁne jewelry. [Vapheio cup]

variable: any dimension, quality, or measurement that varies.
variant:  a  term  used  in  projectile  typology  to  describe  a  variation  of 

a type.

variety: a group of artifacts within a type that have other more speciﬁc
attributes in common; for example, pottery made over several genera-
tions by the same family.

varnished  ware:  pottery  decorated  with  roughcast  scales  or  roundels, 
usually  small  bowls  or  roughcast  beakers,  in  white  fabric  with  a 
greenish-brown  shiny  slip.  They  occur  from  around  the  1st  century
bc/ad of central Gaul and the Rhine.

vase: a decorative container without handles, typically made of glass or

china and used as an ornament or for displaying cut ﬂowers.

vase support: a pottery vessel with a hollow cylindrical base which sup-
ports a dishlike upper surface; the name for a pottery pedestal or ring
made  to  support  round-based  pottery  that  could  not  stand  by  itself
on a ﬂat surface. The term is used especially in European prehistory to
describe  highly  decorated  incised  examples  from  the  French  Middle
Neolithic Chasséen culture. [vase-support]

vat: a large container for holding or storing liquids.
vein quartz: a relatively pure type of quartz which is found in veins in

areas of igneous rocks.

vellum: ﬁne parchment from the skins of calves, a term that was broadened
in its usage to include any especially ﬁne parchment. In the 4th cen-
tury ad vellum or parchment as a material and the codex as a form
became dominant.

ventral: in ﬂakes and blades, toward the side that was not exposed until

after removal from the core. [ventral surface]

Venus  ﬁgurine:  small  female  statuettes  of  the  Upper  Paleolithic,  found
from southwest France to European Russia. They are statuettes, sculp-
tured in the round, of naked and often obese women. The ﬁgures, some-
times  with  exaggerated  abdomen,  breasts,  and  buttocks,  were  made
of  clay,  stone,  antler,  bone,  limestone,  steatite,  or  mammoth  ivory,
and  have  been  found  on  Eastern  Gravettian  and  Upper  Périgordian
sites  from  the  Pyrenees  to  eastern  Russia.  The  heads  are  featureless
and the legs and arms are little emphasized. They mainly date from the

VITREOUS

333

period 30,000–15,000 years ago; a later series is different in character,
more slender and hollow stomached, and are contemporary with the
Magdalenian.

vertical axis: an imaginary line that is perpendicular to the base line and
runs  through  the  center  of  the  artifact  as  it  is  oriented  for  drawing.
It is the axis upon which the artifact is rotated, one-quarter for a proﬁle,
one-quarter for a back view, so that each feature and ﬂake scar main-
tains its distance above the base line in the views of the front, proﬁle,
and back.

Verwood  ware:  medieval  and  later  pottery  industry  based  in  the  New

Forest of southern England.

vesicular ware: pottery whose fabric embodies crushed calcite (either shell
or mineral grit) as a tempering agent, used especially for kitchen wares
such as storage jars, cooking pots, and bowls. [calcite-gritted ware]

vessel: an object used as a container (especially for liquids).
vice:  an  appliance  for  holding  an  object  while  work  is  done  on  it;  it 

usually has a pair of jaws.

Victoria West: a technique for preparing cores by removing a single ﬂake,
which is Levallois-like and associated with Earlier Stone Age assembl-
ages of interior South Africa. [Victoria West technique]

Vicús:  early  Horizon  culture  of  the  Piura  Basin  in  north  Peru  where 
deep  shaft  tombs  were  discovered.  The  Vicús  tombs  have  produced
abundant  metalwork,  modeled  wares  resembling  the  Gallinazo  style
and early Moche ceramics, and a local style of pottery with negative
painting. Vicús material covers most of the 1st millennium ad and was
eventually replaced by Chimú.

Viking Age: the period of Scandinavian history from c. ad 700 to 1100
that begins with the ﬁrst Viking raids on western Europe at the end
of the 8th century. Therefore, the period is more narrowly deﬁned as
the 9th to 11th centuries.

Villafranchian: a major division of early Pleistocene deposits and time,
named for a sequence of terrestrial sediments studied in the region of
Villafranca d’Asti, an Italian town near Turin. This was a time when
new mammals suddenly appeared in the Lower Pleistocene period. The
Villafranchian is also signiﬁcant because within it the earliest hominids
that clearly evolved into modern man (the australopithecines) appeared.
The Villafranchian is in part contemporaneous with the Blancan stage
of North America.

viscosity: resistance of a ﬂuid to ﬂow; the thickness or stiffness of a ﬂuid
(such as a slip or glaze) causing it to resist being stirred or not to ﬂow/
run once applied to a body.

vitreous: like glass in appearance or physical properties; also, of a sub-

stance, derived from or containing glass.

334

VITRIFICATION

vitriﬁcation: the melting and fusion of glassy minerals within clay during
the high-temperature ﬁring of pottery (above 1000°C), resulting in loss
of  porosity.  It  occurs  when  clay  particles  fuse  together  as  glass  – 
a  process  starting  between  800  and  900°C  and  completed  at  about
1200°C.

void: an open space in a pottery fabric. [pore]
volute: a spiral scroll decorating capitals of the Ionic order.
votive deposit: an object or group of objects left in a sacred place as an
offering to a divinity generally with the intention of securing a favor
or expressing gratitude or devotion. Votive deposits were often made
at natural sites (e.g., caves, rivers, lakes, or peat bogs) and, unlike other
types of hoard, were not intended to be recovered later. [votive model,
votives]

voussoir: wedge-shaped stone building block used in constructing an arch

or vault.

W

wadjet eye: the left eye of Horus, restored by the god Thoth, and used
commonly as a symbol in the New Kingdom. It symbolized the power
of healing and was a powerful protective amulet.

waisted ax: large Pleistocene stone tool with a ﬂaked cutting edge and
ﬂaked notch on each margin, thereby giving it a waist for hafting. It
was made in New Guinea and in Australia. [waisted axe]

Wajil: unglazed earthenware of the Korean Proto-Three Kingdoms period

that was hard-ﬁred and reduced.

wampum: small cylindrical beads made from polished shells and fash-
ioned into strings or belts, formerly used by certain Native American
peoples as currency and jewelry or for ceremonial exchanges between
groups. [peag]

Wandjina  ﬁgure:  a  type  of  anthropomorphic  bichrome  or  polychrome
painting made in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, succeeding
the Bradshaw style (c. 3000 bc) and persisting to the present. Wandjina
takes its name from the ancestor spirits depicted in the paintings. The
large  white  spirit  ﬁgures  are  outlined  in  black  and  have  mouthless,
circular faces that are framed in red, rayed halos. The Bradshaw style
was a series of bichrome and monochrome ﬁgures.

ware: generally, articles made of pottery or ceramic. Speciﬁcally, ware
is a class of pottery whose members share similar technology, paste,
and surface treatment.

warming pan: a pan with a long handle which would be ﬁlled with coals

and drawn over sheets to warm a bed.

warp: the fairly rigid foundation of basketry.
warp and weft: in weaving, the warp constitutes the foundation threads
that  run  lengthwise  and  the  weft  threads  are  the  horizontal  threads

336

WARP  AND  WEFT

that interlace through the warp at right angles. Warp provides the fairly
rigid foundation in basketry and weft is the more ﬂexible stitching.
warpoint: small, late prehistoric, general-purpose projectile points with

triangular conﬁguration and no notches or stem.

warp-weighted loom: an apparatus on which textiles are made, with the
warp threads running lengthwise through the material and weighted
on one end while the other ends are secured to the loom itself.

Warring States period: a division of the Zhou/Chou dynasty, 475–221 bc,
the  latter  part  of  the  Eastern  Zhou/Chou  period,  made  up  of  six  or
seven small feuding Chinese kingdoms. The Warring States period saw
the rise of many of the great philosophers of Chinese civilization, includ-
ing the Confucian thinkers Mencius and Hsün-tzu, and the establish-
ment  of  many  of  the  governmental  structures  and  cultural  patterns
that were to characterize China for the next 2000 years. The Warring
States period is distinguished from the preceding age, the Spring and
Autumn (Ch’un Ch’iu) period (770–476 bc), when the country was
divided into many even smaller states. In 223 bc, Ch’in defeated Ch’u
and 2 years later established the ﬁrst uniﬁed Chinese empire.

washer: a small disk or ﬂat ring of metal, wood, or leather.
waste ﬂake: a byproduct, eliminated or thrown away as worthless after
the making of a stone tool; either a larger piece ﬂaked off from the
original stone (primary waste ﬂake) or a smaller piece removed dur-
ing ﬁnishing (secondary waste ﬂake). [debitage, waste]

waster:  a  name  for  the  waste  product  of  the  pottery  manufacturing 
process. This could occur when the clay choice was bad or there was
a  problem  in  the  mixing  of  clays  or  problems  in  ﬁring.  These  ﬁnds
may  suggest  the  presence  of  kilns  or  other  pot-ﬁring  structures.  It
includes any refuse deposit of vessels or fragments of vessels that were
cracked,  warped,  or  otherwise  damaged  and  made  unusable  during
ﬁring. [waster dump]

water smoking: preheating; the initial phase of the ﬁring cycle in which
all mechanically held water in the clay piece is volatized and removed
by slow heating to about 120°C.

weathering:  the  process  whereby  materials  are  altered  through  time. 
This  can  occur  at  various  speeds,  depending  on  the  composition  of
the  objects,  the  environment  in  which  they  are  buried,  and  changes
in the environment.

weaving:  interlacing  of  long,  thin  materials,  such  as  yarn  or  thread  to
make cloth (fabric) or baskets. Wool, cotton, silk, ﬂax, or some other
plant or animal ﬁber can be used for the yarn or thread to produce
textiles of various sorts by criss-crossing the yarns together in at least
two directions. Warp threads are those which run up and down the
length of a piece of textile, and weft threads are those that run across

WERE-JAGUAR

337

the  weave  at  right  angles  to  the  warp.  Many  different  patterns  are
possible, producing different kinds of textile and styles of weave. Patterns
can  be  introduced  by  using  different  colored  threads  in  a  set  order.
The  earliest  evidence  of  weaving  is  that  represented  as  textile  and 
ﬂexible basketry impressions on burnt clay from Pavlov in the Czech
Republic, which date to between 25,000 and 23,000 bc. The oldest
woven cloth so far discovered is made from ﬂax, dates to about 7000 bc,
and comes from Çayönü, Turkey.

weaving  comb:  a  bone  or  wooden  handled  implement  with  a  toothed
edge, used in weaving to pack the weft together tightly. The prongs
of the weaving comb ﬁt between the warp threads to allow the exer-
tion of downward or lateral pressure on the accumulating weft.

wedge:  1.  To  knead  or  mix  a  plastic  clay  body  with  the  hands  or 
feet or to cut and rejoin the mass before kneading. This eliminates air
pockets, randomizes the orientation of particles, compresses the mass,
and provides uniform distribution of moisture. 2. An object, usually
wood or metal used to force open or keep open another object. It is
often  used  to  split  timber  by  striking  the  thick  end  and  forcing  the
wood apart.

wedge-shaped microcore: a core that is small and keel- or wedge-shaped
and used to make microblades. They have been found in eastern Europe,
Siberia, Mongolia, northern China, Alaska, northwestern North America,
and Japan on Upper Paleolithic sites from the close of the Pleistocene.

weft: the comparatively ﬂexible stitching of basketry.
Weichselian:  the  ﬁnal  glacial  advance,  c.  115,000–10,000 bp,  corre-
sponding  to  the  Alpine  Würm,  American  Wisconsinan,  and  British
Devensian. The Weichsel glacial stage followed the Eemian interglacial
stage  and  marks  the  last  major  incursion  of  Pleistocene  continental
ice  sheets.  It  is  named  for  the  ice  sheet  of  north  Germany  and 
other  Quaternary  glacial  deposits  in  northwest  Europe.  Most  of  the
Weichselian is within the range of radiocarbon dating. The ice sheets
were probably at their maximum size for only a short period, between
30,000 and 13,000 bp; eight interstadials have been recognized in the
Weichselian of northwest Europe. The late Weichsel expansion of the
Scandinavian continental ice sheet began about 25,000 years ago, and
most of the Weichselian sediments over northern Europe are part of
this late Weichselian cold period.

weight: stone, clay, or metal object of standard weight used in measurement
on balances or scales of some kind; an object used to weigh something
down or to measure the weight of another object.

were-jaguar:  a  creature  with  human  infant  and  jaguar  features,  which
was important in Olmec art. It has a babylike expression, fangs, snarling
mouth, and other feline facial features. The number and unity of the

Weights, Egyptian

338

WERE-JAGUAR

objects in this style ﬁrst suggested to scholars that they were dealing
with  a  new  and  previously  unknown  civilization.  There  is  a  whole 
spectrum of such were-jaguar forms in Olmec art, ranging from the
almost purely feline to the human in which only a trace of jaguar can
be seen. The Olmec monuments were generally carved in the round,
and  were  technically  very  advanced  even  though  the  only  methods 
available were pounding and pecking with stone tools. Considerable
artistry can also be seen in the pottery ﬁgurines of San Lorenzo, which
depict  nude  and  sexless  individuals  with  were-jaguar  traits.  The
Olmec also worshipped a rain deity depicted as a were-jaguar.

West  Slope  ware:  pottery  of  the  Hellenistic  period  decorated  with 
simple  designs,  found  on  the  west  slope  of  the  Athens  Acropolis.  It
evolved  from  black-glossed  pottery  and  was  decorated  in  white  and
yellow  with  some  incision.  Corinth  and  Crete  were  also  centers  of 
its production.

Western  Style  Neolithic  pottery:  a  type  of  plain  or  lightly  decorated 
Early and Middle Neolithic pottery of the western British Isles – mainly
round-based  bowls  that  were  thin-walled,  hard,  dark-brown,  and
with a shouldered proﬁle. [Western Neolithic ware]

Western  Zhou  (Chou)  period:  a  division  of  the  Zhou/Chou  dynasty,
1027–771 bc, the earlier part of the Zhou/Chou dynasty, starting with
the  fall  of  the  Shang  dynasty.  The  ﬁrst  Zhou/Chou  rulers  parceled 
out  their  expanding  territory  among  feudal  lords.  As  the  feudal 
states rose in power and independence, so did central Zhou/Chou itself
shrink,  to  be  further  weakened  by  the  eastward  shift  of  the  capital
from sites in the Wei River valley near modern-day Sian to Lo-yang
in 771 bc. Thereafter, the Zhou/Chou Empire was broken up among
rival states.

wheel:  1.  One  of  man’s  simplest  but  most  important  inventions.  A
Sumerian  (Erech)  pictograph,  dated  about  3500 bc,  shows  a  sledge
equipped with wheels. It is also shown in Uruk pictographs, c. 3400 bc,
and  on  the  Royal  Standard  of  Ur.  Early  wheels  were  solid  and  un-
wieldy,  made  of  a  single  piece  of  wood  or  three  carved  planks
clamped together by transverse struts. Spoked wheels appeared about
2000 bc, when they were in use on chariots in Asia Minor. The wheel
was  not  used  in  pre-Columbian  America,  except  in  Mexico,  where 
small  pull-along  toys  in  the  form  of  animals  were  made  in  terra 
cotta. The use of a wheel (turntable) for pottery had also developed
in Mesopotamia by 3500 bc. 2. A pivoted, possibly mechanically or
electrically driven, device capable of sustained rotation upon which a
potter builds a vessel, making use of centrifugal force produced at high
rotation speeds to aid in lifting and shaping the piece to its ﬁnal form.
[potter’s wheel]

Spoked wheel,

late 2nd millenium BC,

from Choqa Zanbil

WICK

339

wheel-throwing: in ceramics manufacture, a technique using centrifugal
force to help force the body upwards and outwards from the center of
a ball of tempered clay, while the potter’s hands restrict outward motion
and shape the vessel. [wheel construction; wheel-thrown (adj.)]

whetstone:  a  ﬁne-grained  hone  stone  used  to  sharpen  other  tools  and

for giving a smooth edge to cutting tools after grinding.

whirligig: in early Celtic art, a motif comprising three or four conjoined
spirals either radiating from, or swirling about, a common center, of
which  one  element  may  be  eccentric,  being  larger  or  more  complex
than  the  others.  The  four-part  version  may  appear  as  a  curvilinear 
rendering of the swastika motif. As with similar motifs in Celtic art,
it may be used in a series or as part of a larger design.

whistle: a small wind instrument for making whistling sounds by means
of the breath; a device for making whistling sounds by means of forced
air or steam.

Whitby-type ware: middle Saxon pottery made with a slow-turning wheel

from around Whitby in North Yorkshire, England.

White pottery: soft white, fairly rare, earthenware made only in the Shang
period (dates given for the founding of the Shang dynasty vary from
about  1760  to  1520 bc;  dates  for  the  dynasty’s  fall  also  vary  from
1122 to 1030 bc). Found chieﬂy at Anyang, China, it was probably made
for ritual or mortuary purposes and was decorated with incised geo-
metric patterns. It is made of almost pure kaolin and is very brittle;
few pots have survived unbroken.

white-ground: Athenian pottery technique, especially of the 5th century
bc, where white slip was applied to the vessel surface and the decora-
tion was painted on that. The white-ground lekythoi – funerary vases
with the ﬁgures painted in color against a white background – are the
most common shapes employing this technique. It was also used on
monumental funerary lekythoi. The white-ground lekythoi are believed
to be the most reliable source of information about monumental Greek
paintings of the Classical period. [white-ground ware]

whiteware:  a  class  of  ceramics  including  porcelain,  china,  pottery,
earthenware, stoneware, and vitreous tile that is usually white and con-
sists typically of clays, feldspar, potter’s ﬂint, and whiting.

whorl: something that whirls, coils, or spirals. It is also a circular object
with a central perforation used to weight the end of a spindle and act
as a ﬂy wheel, giving momentum to its rotation while spinning thread.
This drum-shaped section on the lower part of a spindle in spinning
or weaving machinery served as a pulley for the tape drive that rotates
the spindle.

wick: a twisted ﬁber that is immersed in wax, grease, or oil, except for

one end which is lit.

WICKERWORK

wickerwork: woven basketry composed of a ﬂexible thin weft and a thick

warp; work consisting of interlaced osiers, twigs, or rods.

willow pattern: a conventional design in pottery featuring a Chinese scene
depicted  in  blue  on  white,  typically  including  ﬁgures  on  a  bridge,  a
willow tree, and birds.

willowleaf point: late Solutrean ﬂake tool – slim, with rounded ends and

retouching on one side only – of extremely ﬁne workmanship.

Winchester style: style of manuscript illumination, ivory carving, stone
sculpture, metalwork, embroidery, and architecture from the capital of
late Saxon England, c. 10th century ad. The emphasis was on natural-
istic  ﬁgure  design;  acanthus  decoration  is  prominent  in  manuscripts
and  the  stone  angels  carved  over  the  chancel  arch  of  Bradford-on-
Avon church.

Winchester  ware:  late  Saxon  or  Saxo-Norman  earthenware  pottery 
dating to c. ad 850–1150 in southern England, etc. It is wheel-thrown
in  a  sandy  fabric  with  a  yellowish-red  or  green-colored  glaze,  often
decorated with lines, rouletting, stamped rosettes, cordons, or applied
strips. The vessels included spouted pitchers, cups, bowls, jars, tripod
pitchers, and bottles.

Windermere interstadial: an interstadial of the Devensian cold stage that
occurred c. 13,000–11,000 bp. It consisted of a rapid temperature rise
to an initial thermal maximum, followed by a slight temperature decline
at 12,000 bp. It stabilized until 11,000 bp, when it fell sharply at the
start of the Loch Lomond stadial. The Windermere interstadial may
be correlated with Godwin’s Pollen Zone II.

window:  an  opening  in  a  wall  or  roof,  ﬁtted  with  glass  in  a  frame  to

admit light or air and allow people to see out.

window glass: sheet glass cut in shapes for windows or doors.
window lead:  lead  came  subdividing  the  quarries  of  glass  and  holding

them in place in a leaded light. [window-lead]

wineskin: a ﬂexible container, usually leather, for the storage and trans-

portation of wine.

winged axhead: a form of bronze axhead of Middle or Late Bronze Age
date in which narrow, high ﬂanges on both faces are hammered over
to enclose the ax haft. Some types feature a side loop to further assist
hafting. [winged axehead]

winged  chape:  a  metal  cap  for  the  end  of  a  sword  scabbard  with  one
or  more  projecting  ribs  or  wings  so  that  a  swordsperson  on  horse-
back  could  hold  the  scabbard  with  a  boot  heel  while  drawing  a 
sword. These date from the European later Bronze Age (Hallstatt C).
[wing-shaped chape]

winged disk: a sun disk with an outspread pair of wings attached, found
in Egypt from the 1st dynasty. It is associated with Horus of Behdet

WOODLAND

341

(Edfu), and symbolizes the sun, and is found especially in architecture
on ceilings, cornices, and stelae. It was often copied outside Egypt –
for  example,  it  was  used  in  the  Levant  and  by  the  Hittites,  and  in
Assyria it represented the sun god Shamash and perhaps Ashur. It was
adopted  by  the  Achaemenid  Persians  to  represent  their  chief  god
Ahuramazda. [‘py wer (Egyptian), winged disc]

wire: metal drawn out into a thin ﬂexible thread or rod.
Wisconsin glaciation: as an “age” it is a major North American geochrono-
logical subdivision of the Pleistocene epoch, c. 75,000–10,000 bp. It
was the ﬁnal glaciation of North America, the fourth and last glacial
stage of the Pleistocene. It followed the Sangamon interglacial and is
the  North  American  equivalent  of  the  Würm  glaciation  in  the  Old
World; it is broadly correlated with the Weichselian of northwest Europe
and the Devensian of Britain. At certain times during this glaciation,
enough water was locked up in the form of ice sheets to cause a drop
in sea level and the creation of a land bridge between Siberia and Alaska.
It was probably during one such period that man colonized America
from Asia. As a “stage” it is a chronostratigraphic subdivision of the
Pleistocene,  with  deposits  in  the  upper  US  Midwest  and  adjacent 
areas of Canada. Most of the Wisconsin deposits can be dated by radio-
carbon. The sequence has been divided into Early Wisconsin (c. 75,000–
53,000 bp), Middle Wisconsin (53,000–23,000 bp), and Late Wisconsin
(23,000–10,000 bp).  The  substages  have  been  deﬁned  as:  Altonian 
(c. 75,000–25,000 bp), Farmdalian (c. 25,000–22,500 bp), Woodfordian
(c.  22,500–12,500 bp),  Twocreekan  (c.  12,500–11,800 bp),  and
Greatlakean (c. 11,800–10,000 or 7000 bp). The latter replaced the
Valderan substage.

Wolstonian: in Britain, a penultimate cold stage spanning c. 200,000–
125,000 bp. At the type site in the Midlands, Wolstonian deposits over-
lie interglacial deposits of the Hoxnian. The Wolstonian deposits have
Acheulian and Levalloisian artifacts.

wooden chamber: a log or board enclosure that contained nested wooden
cofﬁns  and  grave  goods  placed  on  display  ledges  within  them.  The
large  wooden  cofﬁns  were  an  important  form  of  burial  from  Late
Neolithic  times  in  China.  Wooden  chambers  diffused  to  Korea  and
Japan in the early centuries ad.

Woodland:  a  general  term  for  cultural  groups  living  in  the  wooded, 
eastern parts of North America during the Formative period. Woodland
subsumes many local adaptations, but in general these were hunter-
gatherer communities whose subsistence base was augmented with some
cultivation. Woodland communities used pottery and had elaborate tool-
making and artistic traditions. Burials were usually made in established
cemeteries, often within large earthen mounds. Trade networks were

extensive.  Starting  about  1000 bc,  Woodland  comprises  a  series  of 
distinctive  cultures  including  the  Adena,  Hopewell,  Mississippian,
and Iroquoian. In some areas Woodland societies continued down to
modern times.

woodworking: the act, art, or trade of working with wood.
woomera: a spear-throwing device used by Australian aborigines.
worked:  a  term  used  in  projectile  point  descriptions  that  describes  an
area of an artifact which has been shaped or altered by man, such as
the removal of ﬂakes along a blade edge.

working range: variable amounts of water that may be added to a dry

clay to make it satisfactorily plastic.

wrist clasp: a type of metal object in pagan Saxon graves in the Anglian
areas of England and on the European continent. They were ﬂattened
rectangular or triangular pieces of bronze, often gilded or inlaid with
silver and decorated with animal ornament. They were used to fasten
the cuffs of tunics.

wristguard: a rectangular plate of bone or stone, perforated on the ends
and strapped to the forearm of an archer to prevent injury when the
bowstring recoils. It is sometimes difﬁcult to distinguish a wristguard
from a whetstone. They occur commonly in Beaker contexts in Europe.

wrought iron: iron having a low carbon content that is tough and mal-

leable and so can be forged and welded.

wrought nail: a nail that is beaten out or shaped by hammering.
Würm:  the  fourth  and  ﬁnal  Pleistocene  glaciation  in  the  European 
Alps, c. 110,000/70,000–10,000 years ago, ending with the onset of
the postglacial Holocene. The Würm glacial stage followed the Riss-
Würm interglacial and is correlated with the Weichsel glacial stage of
northern Europe and the Wisconsin glacial stage of North America.
It is divided into early, middle, and late phases. The end of the Würm
and the retreat of the ﬁnal glaciers was a complex of minor retreats
and advances.

Xanthian Marbles: sculptures found at Xanthus, the principal city of ancient
Lycia (Turkey), now in the British Museum. The most remarkable ruins
of  the  city  are  the  huge  rock-cut  pillar  tombs.  British  archaeologist
Sir Charles Fellows sent reliefs and sections of the tombs to the British
Museum  in  the  19th  century.  The  ﬁgures  are  Assyrian  in  character,
not later than 500 bc. Sieges, processions, and ﬁgures are shown in
proﬁle  but  with  the  eyes  shown  in  full.  Upon  one  of  the  remaining
pillar tombs is the longest and most important of inscriptions in the
Lycian language.

xoanon: a wooden image thought to have fallen from heaven, such as
the  image  of  Athena  in  the  Erechtheum  on  the  Athenian  Acropolis;
in Greek antiquity, it is a simple, carved image, especially one in which
the original block of stone or wood is readily apparent.

X-ray art: a style of prehistoric rock art depicting animals by drawing
or painting the skeletal frame and internal organs. The origin of the
style  can  be  traced  to  the  Mesolithic  art  of  northern  Europe,  where
the  earliest  examples  were  found  on  fragments  of  bone  in  southern
France  dating  from  the  late  Magdalenian.  Animals  painted  in  the 
X-ray motif have also been discovered in the art of hunting cultures
in northern Spain, Siberia, the Arctic Circle, North America, western
New Guinea, New Ireland, India, and Malaysia. It is found today prim-
arily  in  the  Aboriginal  rock,  cave,  and  bark  paintings  of  eastern
Arnhem  Land,  in  northern  Australia.  Figures  painted  in  X-ray  style
vary in size, up to 2.5 m (8 feet) in length, and are delicate, polychromed
renderings of the interior cavity of the animal. [x-ray art, X-ray style]

Yoke

Yarmouth: a major division of Pleistocene deposits and time in North
America, named for deposits in Yarmouth, Iowa, and equivalent to the
Mindel-Riss interglacial stage of Alpine Europe. In some places, fossil
vertebrates  are  well  represented.  It  was  at  least  as  warm  as  modern
times  and,  in  some  regions,  the  deposits  indicate  that  Yarmouth 
climates may have been semiarid. The dates are c. 300,000–200,000 bp;
the British equivalent is the Hoxnian and the Holsteinian interglacial
in northern Europe.

yellow ware: pottery made from buff clay and covered with a yellowish

transparent clay.

yoke: 1. A large, heavy, U-shaped stone believed to be a ritual copy of
a wooden protector worn by players of the Mesoamerican ball game
during  the  Classic  period.  It  was  worn  on  the  hips  and  decorated 
with  carved  designs  with  double-edge  scrolls.  2.  The  wooden  cross-
piece fastened over the necks of a pair of oxen or horses and attached
to the plow, cart, or wagon to be drawn.

York ware: a type of wheel-thrown late Saxon pottery, c. ad 850–1150,
with cooking pots, jars, pitchers, ﬂagons, bottles, jugs, bowls, and dishes
of hard quartz-gritted fabric, of a light red/brown/gray color.

Yorkshire vase food vessel: an Early Bronze Age ceramic vessel of eastern
England in inhumation burials, c. 1800–1400 bc. They are thick-walled
vessels of coarse fabric with ﬂat bases, decoration on the shoulder and
rim, and often with perforated lugs.

Younger Dryas: a stadial of the Weichselian cold stage, dated to between
11,000 and 10,000 bp. The last glacial recession (13,000–6000 years
ago) was interrupted by this sharp advance. It takes its name from a
tundra plant called Dryas octopetala, fossil remains of which are com-
mon in deposits of the stadial. It was most evident around the North

Atlantic  and  coincided  with  an  apparent  temporary  diversion  of
glacial  meltwater  from  the  Mississippi  River  to  the  St.  Lawrence
drainage  system.  It  has  been  postulated  that  this  discharge  of  cold,
fresh  water  disrupted  the  Atlantic  Ocean  circulation  system  that
warms the North Atlantic.

yue: an olive-colored, glazed stoneware preceding celadon and porcelain
and created during the Tang period of the 3rd to 10th centuries ad
in the Kiangsu and Chekiang provinces.

yuguito: a carved stone, presumably a replication of a wooden yoke sec-

tion, used in the ceremonial ball games.

zemi:  religious  spirits  that  were  represented  by  idols  of  wood,  stones,
shell,  and  bones  in  the  West  Indies.  Zemis  are  human  or  animal  in
form. Ceremonial centers, ball courts, and caves are associated with
the cult, which may have reached the islands from Mesoamerica. The
Taino culture is famous for these zemi carvings, which are found in
many of the islands, notably Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. A distinc-
tive  trait  of  the  Antillean  Arawaks  was  the  triangular  carved  stone
zemi  that  represented  the  hierarchically  ranked  individual  guardian
deities of each household in the society. [Zemi; zemis (pl.)]

Zeuxippos ware: Byzantine pottery named after the baths of Zeuxippos
in  Istanbul  (then  Constantinople),  Turkey;  dated  to  the  12th  to 
13th centuries ad.

zong: Chinese artifact, a tube of jade with square outer and round inner
perimeters, of unknown symbolism to the southern Neolithic cultures
of  China.  Examples  vary  widely  in  size  and  proportions  and  have 
also been found at both Shang and Zhou/Chou sites. They are often
decorated with the taotie design. The earliest examples come from the
3rd millennium bc. [ts’ung, tsung]

zoomorph: an object, ﬁgure, or picture depicting an animal form, such

as those found in cave paintings, and used as a symbol in art.

zoomorphic: having an animal form or appearance, and attributing the

form or nature of an animal to something, such as a deity.

zoomorphic brooch: a clothes fastener with an animal design or decoration.
Z-twist: the turn of ﬁbers from the top right toward the bottom left.
zun: any of a wide range of Chinese vessel types, generally of the Shang
dynasty  (18th  to  12th  century  bc)  and  early  Zhou/Chou  dynasty 
(1111 to c. 900 bc), probably meant for containing wine. There are
two basic varieties: one shaped like a much enlarged ku, tall and some-
what trumpet-shaped; the other of various animal shapes, often with
animal decoration. [tsun]


Detecting Fraud And Forgery In Papers And Documents

The art of detecting forgery or fraud, in checks, drafts, documents,

seals, writing materials, or in the characters themselves is a study

that has attracted handwriting experts since its study was taken up.

There are almost infallible rules for the work and in this chapter is

given several new methods of research that will prove of the utmost

value to the public.

It is not an uncommon occurrence that wills and other public documents

are changed by the insertion of extra or substituted pages, thereby

changing the character of the instrument. Where this is suspected

careful inspection of the paper should be made--first, as to its shade

of color and fiber, under a microscope; second, as to its ruling;

third, as to its water-mark; fourth, as to any indications that the

sheets have been separated since their original attachment; fifth, as

to the writing--whether or not it bears the harmonious character of

the continuous writing, with the same pen and ink, and coincident

circumstances, or if typewritten, whether or not by the same operator

or the same machine. It would be a remarkable fact if such change were

to be made without betraying some tangible proof in some one or more

of the above enumerated respects.

Books of accounts are often changed by adding fictitious or fraudulent

entries in such spaces as may have been left between the regular

entries or at the bottom of the pages where there is a vacant space.

Where such entries are suspected, there should be at first a careful

inspection of the writing as to its general harmony with that which

precedes and follows, as to its size, slope, spacing, ink, and pen

used, and if in a book of original entry, the suspected entry should

be traced through other books, to see if it is properly entered as to

time and place, or vice versa.

The judgment by the naked eye as to the colors or shades of two inks

in the same paper or document is very likely to be erroneous for the

reason that when a lighter ink is more heavily massed than a darker

one the effect on the eye is as if it were the darker. Under a

microscope or magnifying glass the field is more restricted, the finer

lines are broadened, and one has larger areas of ink to compare with

less surface of strongly contrasted white paper. Then, again, an ink

without noticeable bluish tinge to the naked eye may appear quite blue

under the glass where the films of ink are broadened and thinned and

their characters better observed.

In order to judge whether two marks have been made by the same ink,

they should be viewed by reflected light to note the color, luster and

thickness of the ink film. Many inks blot or "run" on badly sized

paper--i.e., the lines are accompanied by a paler border which

renders their edges less well defined.

Even on well-sized papers this class of inks usually exhibits only a

stained line of no appreciable thickness where the fluid has touched

the paper.

The copying and glossy inks, which often contain a considerable

quantity of gum, do not "run" or blot even on partially sized paper,

and show under the glass a convexity on the surface of the line and an

appreciable thickness of the film.

It does not always follow when an ink has made a blur on one part of

the paper and not on another that the paper has been tampered with. A

drop of water accidentally let fall on the blank page will frequently

affect the sizing in that place, and, besides, all papers are not

evenly sized in every part.

The inks rich in gum, or those concentrated by evaporation from

standing in an open inkstand, give a more lustrous and thicker stroke.

Some inks penetrate deeper into the paper than others, and some

produce chemical effects upon the sizing and even upon the paper

itself, so that the characters can easily be recognized on the

underside of the sheet. In some old documents the ink has been known

to so far destroy the fiber of the paper that a slight agitation of

the sheet would shake out as dust much of the part which it covered,

thus leaving an imperfect stencil plate of the original writing.

Distilled water is very useful in many cases to ascertain whether

paper has been scratched and partially sized or treated with resin. If

it has not been altered by chemical agents, the partial sizing and the

resinous matter used give to the paper a peculiar appearance. Sizing

takes away from the whiteness of the paper, and, thinned by the

scratching or washing, it absorbs much more quickly even when it has

been partially sized.

A simple mode of operation is to place a document or paper suspected

of being a forgery, on a sheet of paper or better still, on a piece of

glass; then moisten little by little with a paint brush all parts of

it, paying close attention to the behavior of the liquid as it comes

in contact with the paper.

By means of water one can discover what acids, alkalis, or salts the

parts of the paper with colored borders or white spots contain.

With the aid of a pipette cover these spots with water and let it

remain for ten or fifteen minutes; then with the pipette remove the

liquid and examine the products it holds in solution. Afterwards make

a comparative experiment on another part of the paper which is neither

spotted nor whitened.

If the original writing has been done with a very acid ink on a paper

containing a carbonate, such as calcium carbonate, the ink, in

attacking the calcareous salt, stains the paper, so that if the forger

has removed the ferruginous salts this removal is denoted by the

semi-transparence that water gives to the paper.

To study carefully the action of the water it is necessary to repeat

the experiment several times, allowing the paper to dry thoroughly

before recommencing it.

According to Tarry, it is necessary to have recourse to alcohol to

discover whether the paper has been scratched in any of the parts and

then covered with a resinous matter to prevent the ink from blotting.

Place the document on a sheet of white paper and with a paint brush

dipped in alcohol of specific gravity 0.86 or 0.87 cover the place

supposed to have been tampered with. It may be discovered if the

writing thickens and runs when the alcohol has dissolved the resin.

Hold the paper moistened with alcohol between the eye and the light;

the thinning of the paper shows the work of the forger.

Some more skillful forgers use paste and resin at the same time to

mask their fraudulent operations; in this case luke-warm water should

be first employed and then alcohol; water to dilute the paste, and

alcohol to dissolve the resin. The result is that the ink added on the

places scratched out spreads, and the forgery is easily seen.

Test-papers (litmus, mauve, and Georgina paper) serve to determine

whether a paper has been washed either by the help of chemical agents,

acids incompletely removed, or the surplus of which has been saturated

by an alkali, or by the help of alkaline substances. The change of the

color to red indicates an acid substance; an alkali would turn the

reddened litmus paper to blue, and the mauve and Georgina test-papers

to green.

Take a sheet of test-paper of the same dimensions as the document to

be examined, moisten it, and cover it underneath with a sheet of

Swedish filter-paper. These two sheets together (the filter-paper

underneath) are then applied to the document which has been moistened

already. The whole is then laid between two quires of paper, covered

by a weighted board, and left in this condition for about an hour. At

the end of this time examine the test-paper to see if it has partly or

altogether changed color. This examination finished, put the

test-paper in contact with distilled water, to be afterwards removed

and tried by appropriate tests to discover the nature of the alkali or

acid present.

Silver nitrate is also used to discover whether the paper has been

washed with chlorine or chlorites. A paper in that way becomes acid.

The chlorine changes to hydrochloric acid, which dissolves in the

water with which the suspected document or paper is moistened, and at

the contact of silver nitrate little spots of silver chloride appear.

There are various other tests such as gallo-tannic acid or infusion

of nutgalls prepared a short time before application and may be used

with advantage to restore writings that have been removed by washing.

Place the document or paper on a sheet of white paper and moisten the

whole of its surface with a paint brush dipped in the reagent, taking

care not to rub it or strongly press it. When the surface is well

impregnated allow the solution to act for an hour, and at the end of

this time examine the document again. Then moisten it a second time

and the following day, examine the results. Repeat the moistening

several times if necessary, for it often takes some time to make the

traces of writing reappear.

Chevallier and Lassaigne experimented together on the effect produced

by the vapor of iodine on the surface of the papers or documents upon

which the alteration of writing was suspected. Take a bottle with a

wide mouth from ten to eleven centimeters in height, and the opening

from five to six centimeters in width. This last is covered by a disk

of unpolished glass. Into the bottom of this vessel introduce from

twenty to thirty grams of iodine in crystals.

Place the portion of paper on which the vapor of iodine is to act at

the opening of the bottle, and cover it with the stopper of unpolished

glass, on which put a weight so as to exert a slight pressure, and in

order that the aperture may be hermetically closed. Then allow the

vapor of iodine to act on the dry paper for three or four minutes at

the temperature of 15 deg. to 16 deg. C. and examine it attentively. Whe

n the

surface has not been spotted by any liquid (water, alcohol, salt

water, vinegar, saliva, tears, urine acids, acid salts, or alkalis) a

uniform pale-yellow or yellowish-brown tinge will be noticed on all

parts of the paper exposed to the vapor of iodine.

Otherwise a different and easily distinguished tinge shows itself on

the surface that has been moistened and then dried in the open air.

Machine-made papers with starchy and resinous sizing give such decided

reactions that sometimes it is possible to distinguish by the color

the portion of the paper treated with alcohol from that moistened with

water. The spot produced by alcohol takes a kind of yellow tinge; that

formed by water becomes a violet blue, more or less deep, after having

dried at an ordinary temperature. As to the spots produced by other

aqueous liquids, they approach in appearance, though not in intensity,

those occasioned by pure water. Feeble acids, or those diluted by

water, act like water; but the concentrated mineral acids, in altering

more or less the substance of the sizing, produce spots that present

differences.

Spots which become apparent by using vapor of iodine are due to

chemical agents whose strength has altered either the fibers of the

surface, or the paste uniting them.

In a word, the test of a document or paper by vapor of iodine has the

double advantage of indicating the place of the supposed alteration

and operating afterwards with appropriate reagents to bring back the

traces of ink. It is only the reappearance of former letters or

figures written or effaced that demonstrates forgery. Much time may be

profitably spent in merely scanning each letter of a document, and the

writing by lines, paragraphs, and pages before a closer scrutiny.

Gradually, if the writing be genuine, its character will begin to

reveal itself, and unconsciously a hypothesis as to the physical

causes of the irregularities or characteristics will be formed.

When an entire document or page is forged, the ornamentation,

flourishes, or the capitals at its head will often be seen to be out

of keeping, either with its nature or with the supposed author's

habits in similar cases. In a writing all must agree, place, day,

year, handwriting, superscription or heading, signature, and material

carrying the writing, especially paper, both as to constitution and

color and ink.
